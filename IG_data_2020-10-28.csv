You cannot compare this with previous Sims like 3 or 2. Even 4 yrs after release the build mode still lacks in huge amount of tools we used to have. The biggest issue l have that somehow the development team is not really able to provide matching sets in all categories. Some color choices are questionable and very limited. If you plan to stick with the basegame only you won't explore the full fun. You will need to buy DLCs to improve the gameplay. Overall l dislike a lot of things how they handled yet it captivates me and am intrigued by my simmies. I hope they will improve even though they started to recolor and adjust certain meshes which get repetitive and EA wants money for that, too but the Sim community provides million of custom content you can add and make this game your own and with DLCs you can add some gameplay.

Néanmoins, oui car tout n'est pas parfait dans ce pack, je dirais qu'il faut réfléchir à ce qu'on attend vraiment des Sims avant de l'acheter. Gérer l'empreinte écologique de tous nos mondes est vraiment intéressant, et le fait d'avoir un projet communautaire pour lesquels nos sims d'un même monde doivent se rencontrer, échanger entre eux pour gagner des points d'influence sur les votes de projet est intéressant. Malgré tout, je trouve quand même le gameplay assez limité pour un pack d'extension. Recycler des objets, c'est bien, mais je m'imagine mal passer mes journées ""sims"" à faire ça, et on fait vite le tour des nouvelles activités. De plus, l'empreinte écologique de ce que j'ai pu en voir, change très vite et c'est compliqué de gérer la vie de nos sims (leur travail, leurs relations, les autres activités..) et leur rôle dans cette empreinte écologique. Alors, certes je suppose que c'est aussi le but de ce pack que de montrer que c'est un travail quotidien que de protéger l'environnement mais dans les sims on manque un peu de temps pour tout faire ! ^^ Tout ça pour dire que c'est un bon pack, mais pour les petits nouveaux qui se lancent dans le jeu, ce n'est pas un must-have absolu à avoir et je dirais qu'il est bien une fois qu'on a déjà fait le tour de la plupart des DLC les plus essentiels.",80

First thing is that you are here to see a review for the MULTIPLAYER and not the SINGLEPLAYER, (Campaign) there are way better games for that. The main reason I got this is because I always loved killing people and getting those radical killstreaks. Not for the campaign, but for the multiplayer. If you are here for the campaign, leave, campaign is about 6 hours long, and there is a lot better games for that, like Far Cry 4, got lots of hours in that for singleplayer only game time. If you are here for multiplayer, then get your wallet ready!

Some FAQ:

Q: Do people still play?
A: Yes, at certain times and places. Where I am i can get a game quick from 10am to 10pm (West Coast, USA)

Q: Is it worth full price? ($60)
A: No, I did not get it for full price, why should you. Buy on sale or through trading. (Key Trading bots/people)

Q: Should I use my controler?
A: No, you will cry cause you get 0 kills.

Q: Can I read?
A: Yes.

Q: Are you just making up questions to make this review longer?
A: Yes.

Q: Why?
A: Why not? Plus I can't think of them, so ask away!

Review for each part of the game:

Campaign-
No, get other games, its fun but to short.

Multiplayer-

Better then most other CoDs. MW2 I own, to many hackers. MW2 being a good CoD.
This game is one of the best and still has a strong community of people that make it hacker less. 
I also own AW, its bad, and now 0 people are play, #2MuchDLC. 
Worth the buy if it was just for this.

Zombies-
Its another fun game, fun by youself and with others!
Different from most zombie games.

Other Pros/Cons

Pros-
-You get 3 games in your Library
-You only have to download the part of the game you want to play, so less space used!
-Not many hackers! Always a good thing

Cons-
-So much paid DLC; a Gun thats super amazinly good, maps that I would like to play, skins. What is this CS:GO? Paying for skins is so CoD, oh wait.
-Less 8 year olds, I like to talk to them, there fun to mess around with
-Sadly no price drop, unlike MW2 and such old games.

So overall well worth the money for the Multiplayer/Zombies!

Original that made me famous:
Still better then Call of Duty: Ghost

If you just came from work and only want to relax, get it. I guess then it's a ""good"" game for you.

Literally nothing - not a single positive point comes in my mind for Battlefield V.
I am not going to explain why the game is one of the worst games ever developed & if you don't get why, please don't talk.
The actual best state of the game was after the release (Edited this review since then).

If you like this game; following things might be the reason:
- You are a casual & just want to play a game (that's totally okay btw)
- You were promoted/paid by EA/DICE to vote their game up (if so, no words for you)
- You started playing the BF franchise with Battlefield V and you have no idea what a good Battlefield is

Friendly reminder if you care about that point - Battlefield V reveal:
""There won't be any microtransactions! Everything can be unlocked trough just playing the game."" 
Well, take a look now ;)

Just don't .. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, NOR YOUR TIME. Why?
Worse than ever before. Just listing a few negative points:
- Lack of optimization 
- Bugs & glitches
- Complete mess called ""movement""
- Input delay
- Week for week new unplayable playlists
- no RSP with plugins
- In-game / weapon & vehicle balance 
- Countless cheater 
- Skill trees instead of weapon attachments 
- Level & unlock system
- In-game UI
- Random recoil of guns
- Gunplay in general
+ 5 points down below.
... the list could go on.

@DICE SW / EA - Keep doing what you do: Ignore constructive feedback and you ruin your studio(s) even more then you already do now.

Or instead: Shut down this garbage piece of sh*t and don't ever touch Battlefield again, since you love to ruin great games and or genres anyway.

@DICE LA - Fix this game, PLEASE.

You found it. Escape From Tarkov isn't just a normal game it's a simulator that tries to bring something similar to a real life shooting mission to the players. It's still in Beta, sure, but it already has so much content. Some people who purchased this game started crying and raging because they where killed instantly at the beginning of the match after 5 minutes or less. ""Invisible people killed me"" those are just other players that probably where far away shooting with a sniper. A lot of people come and are like ""Oh this game looks like call of duty"" this is where they are wrong. You may be a pro in call of duty but in tarkov you are going to get killed easily. 
The game is really interesting, there are many cool stuff like:

-Drinking and Eating: Yeah this is important because after some time your character is gonna get dehydrated or hungry which makes the whole surviving harder. There are cool animations when the player eats or drinks, bringing more realism to the game.

-Armor: This is a really important factor during the gameplay, in fact if you get into a raid with bad armor or without you have a higher chance of getting killed. Helmets help a lot too but it always depends on what gun was used against you and which kind of bullet. So Based on that a face shiled, for example, could save your life or not.

-Bullets: There are so many bullets in this game than in all the others mixed together and there is an important reason. Basic ammo are usually for beginners or for those who don't want to spend much ingame currency on them. The basic ones sure don't do much damage and a well geared enemy may survive many shots before dying but they are effective versus bots some times. If you instead want to easily kill someone tho you may use penetrating bullets which are the ebst choice for players that want to kill easier their enemies.

-Grenades, Flashbangs and smokes:
Nice and cool animation, the flashbang works properly, some times blinding softly, you can see a flash spot but also the surroundings, and other times hardly, you see the flash spot and nothing else around. The smokes are realisticly looking but there is a - the particles of smoke get through textures smoking parts of a building for example a room close to another where there should not be any smoke. About normal grenades, what to say, they are deadly.

The Valley of the Lost Women 

The setting of the game is simple. The protagonist, sentenced to death by Hyborian, is tied to a cross and left to die in the desert. After being hung briefly, they are suddenly saved by Conan himself; apparently, to somehow justify the name of the game, because the legendary barbarian will never appear again, but before you see the miraculous liberation, the game comes to an abrupt halt for character creation where you can choose your hero’s gender, race, appearance, and religion. After the creation of the hero, you are released into a seamless open world. 

On a note, you can’t help but notice the nature of the editor in character creation. There is an option that allows you to the adjust the size of genitalia and other intimate body parts of the lousily voiced protagonist. While this can be seen as a quirky aspect of the game, with many other things lacking and this only being a catchy superficial detail, it ends up feeling like an attempt to grab more attention. 

There is no tutorial in Conan Exiles. You will have to learn everything through trial and error. In a strict sense of the word, the game has no quests whatsoever. However, there are goals that are shown on the upper right corner of the screen. These help you get acquainted with the basics of the game.

Treasures of Gwalure 

Crafting is an important aspect of the game, and the players will have to mess around with a lot of ingredients for that. At first, it will just be simple materials stones and branches, then you will need rarer resources like: stellar metallic ore, or the blood of a demon. In search of these ingredients, you will have to traverse many beautiful locations - deserts, jungles, snow-covered valleys, swamps, and even a volcano. Unfortunately, the collection of resources is somewhat tiring. Useful materials are hard to find, and instead of getting to admire the scenery of Hyboria, you will mostly be busy cutting down trees, breaking stones, and hunting animals. 

The tools used change what exact resource you will be getting. For instance, if you chop the tree with an axe, there will be some wood, and if you prick the tree with a pick, the bark. The character needs to drink and eat, so as not to die of hunger and thirst. You need to hunt animals for food. And for complete safety, you will want to build a house or even a fortress of your dreams if you are feeling up for it. You can also climb steep cliffs and cook on a bowler hat, something that’s reminiscent of last year’s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. That’s where you are brought back to ground with naked bodies and a game that doesn’t play at all like BotW.

Religion is an important mechanics in the game. Belonging to the confession provides unique equipment recipes, sacrifices allow you to invoke the huge all-destroying avatar of the chosen god. When you start off, the game lets you worship only one deity, but their numbers can be increased later in the game. I'm not a bore, but where is it seen in Hyboria that the minions of Seth, whose teachings completely contradict each other, simultaneously give praise to the solar miter!

Another notable mechanics of the game, a quite unusual one, is slavery. In order to get yourself a slave, you need to trash the enemy before they lose consciousness, then tie them and make them rotate the wheel of pain. It works the same way as it does in Conan’s film. The system of slavery is needed for proper organization and development of economy. A warrior slave can be made to guard the house, the smith slave will make an improved weapon, and the dancers take care of the filth that can be picked up in the ancient ruins.

All the rascals in the house 

Conan Exiles has several modes - PvP (each player was removed from the cross personally by Conan!), online PvE and a singleplayer campaign. The game is punishing; you can die very quickly. The maximum number of players on a server is 40. Although the true potential of the game is reached in multiplayer, the singleplayer campaign is also good - you can play only for that. 

After you die, experience gained and skills learned do not disappear, but the character literally starts with a bare back and only items in the chests are not lost. That is, of course, if you are not playing the campaign on easy difficulty level. In addition to that, you have to start with character creation every time you join a new server in multiplayer, which is really annoying. 

There have been a number of impressive changes after the release, including, but not limited to, an increase in the number of resources, recipes, and monsters. The devs have also added new animations, deities, and biomes. The game has come really far from when it was first released in early access in early 2017. Taking a year and a half for full release from early access worked for the sandbox survival game Conan Exiles, but there are still some quality of life and game balance issues that need to be fixed. The game doesn’t quite capture the feel of the mystical world of Conan: The Barbarian, so it may be the cause of disappointment for fans of franchise, but it is still a solid survival game. Recommended for fans of survival genre.

As a die-hard fan of RPGs and sandboxes, there’s a special place in my mind for The Elder Scrolls Franchise. Since I was introduced to the series back in 2002, I’ve spent hundreds of hours navigating the immense fantasy-themed world of Bethesda in search of adventure, loot, NPCs, and the gorgeous views of surrounding landscapes. It’s a real MMORPG video game released by ZeniMax Online Studios. The game serves as a part of the long-running The Elder Scrolls series and introduces lots of prominent features that you have never seen before. Honestly, there’s nothing about Massively Multiplayer Online games that I dislike; however, I intend to go with freedom of playing solo adventures over guild-based raids. But I’m happy that at least I tried, and I liked it.

Background Story – Be a Hero
The game starts with your favorite character, who escapes from the prison in the daedric realm, Coldharbour. According to the plot, the daedric prince Malog Bal has stolen your soul, with the help of a few new allies, and you return to Tamriel as a vestige. After reaching there, you must spend a hundred hours to complete the challenging quests to approach the level cap of 50. The difficulty level will start increasing with level 10, and the advancement in missions will unlock new stuff. It offers content-driven gameplay and will allow you to experience excellent gameplay with other players from all over the world.
Highly Detailed Environment and Monthly Subscription Model
Similar to other titles in The Elder Scrolls franchise, the game takes place in the continent of Tamriel and introduces a well-written storyline that is indirectly attached to different titles. Like other MMORPGs, the game introduces the monthly subscription model, and it means you must pay monthly charges to keep continuing your gaming service. During the gameplay, you can explore the environment from a third-person perspective to kill other players or enemies to retrieve your soul to become the master. While playing the game, you can use a variety of melee weapons and other gear to earn in-game currency.

Gameplay – What’s new?
Like the previous installment, the game focuses on non-linear gameplay, introduces a perfect combination of free-roaming, random events, quests, and epic battles. Although the game doesn’t present a Single-player offline play, the developers said that there would be a variety of content specially designed for those users who prefer to play solo. There are ten different races categorized into three types, such as:
• Elvish Races
• Humans
• Bestial Races
Before start playing the game, the ultimate job of the player is to choose one of three races and then go with character classes to choose his favorite one out of six, such as:
• Sorcerer
• Templar
• Nightblade
• Dragonknight
• Warden
• Necromancer
You would be happy to know that each class is offering you various attacks, passive effects, and spells.

Setting and Combat System
The world where the game takes place is expansive, but it doesn’t calibrate your sense against other titles available in the series. A limited distance, repetitive buildings, and scenery make you feel the game is smaller than it seems on a map. The main problem is that each zone is offering a single region for players of a specific level range, and as you advance through the game, further zones will be unlocked to navigate. The objectives you complete directly fall into a few categories, including Fetch Quests, Kill Lists, and Simple Object Finding. The complicated combat system of the game hybridizes the traditional Massively Multiplayer Online Rotation System, where the player can cycle through a set of skills and magical powers.

Final Verdict
The Elder Scrolls Online comes with outstanding gameplay, although a few well-structured systems are struggling to overcome lifeless presentation, but tough to recommend. There’s one flaw in the PvP event that the map is too large to explore. Combat was brilliant when I involved in it but found myself wasting lots of hours from reaching one place to another.

Imagine you trapped in a location that you’ve never seemed before and the area is full of deadly creatures venturing for fresh blood, then what would be your strategy for survival. If you’re a hardcore player and loves to play First-person Shooter game with horror-mixed survival gameplay, then 10 Chambers Collective presents GTFO, one of the best FPS 4-player local Co-op video game. Providing you with a combination of Team-based, Atmospheric Puzzle, Violent, Survival, and Zombies game elements, GTFO comes with hardcore gameplay enabling you to play with the other three players, who are struggling for their survival.

GTFO lets you play with friends
It is a First-person Shooter and Survival video game that takes place in the thrilling world full of vicious creatures. In the game, you act as a prisoner who is trapped in a strange land and forced to navigate and extract valuable artifacts to advance the story. Before start fighting against terrifying creatures, you should gather weapons, equipment, and required resources to ensure your survival, while exploring the world from a first-person viewpoint.

Become a Prisoner
The game puts you in charge of a prisoner who doesn’t have any idea about his arrival to the complex environment. The story tells that the protagonist has no memory and needs to find to reveal how he reached over here and must find a way out to survive. There are a variety of modern weapons and each one has its unique statistics. You will start the game with basic weapons, but later can be switched to advance ones after making progress through the story.
Introduction of PvE (Player versus Environment)

The game comes with PvE mode, pitting you against the environment full of terrifying monsters await you. The ultimate objective is to ensure your victory while playing the vicious beasts along with your buddies. Survival requires the completion of specific goals, the defeat of enemies, and specific points you earn after killing targets. To let you experience the detailed gameplay, the game introduces the first-person perspective, which means you can only see the character’s hands loaded with weapons. Explore the massive underground complex to encounter creatures and shoot them down to win rewards and other legendary weapons to become the master.

How to Master GTFO?
Develop a team of four players and embark on a journey of survival by navigating the underground environment and defeating deadly creatures using a set of detailed weapons. Before moving ahead, you choose to plan your expedition by equipping the tools, combining the firepower, and communicating as a team. During the gameplay, every action and detail will count if you are on the way to survive the nightmare. To make sure the survival of your team, you have to reveal every information and resource to help you and the team to solve objectives and come back home.

Verdict
Playing First-person Shooting game is too much fun and you may know that hardcore games sometimes become a headache for average players, but how beautifully the developer did their job to provide fantastic gameplay for all types of players. Although there’s no Single-player campaign, playing the game with friends will let you fully engage yourself in the detailed team-based gameplay experience. Communication with friends is an outstanding feature, taking your gaming experience to the next level, and GTFO comes with a fantastic communication system. The game deserves 10 out of 10, but we would love to give it 9 out of 10, because of not introducing a single-player campaign.

I recommend you buy this game below the current asking price, preferably when a miracle patch hits the live servers. Unfortunately, FatShark Games has a proven track record of doing things too little, too late, promising development road maps, only to implement changes very late into the game's life cycle.

PRO TIPS:

- Avoid opening any ""Commendation Chests"" (level up reward) you might earn, until you reach Power level 600 (max level, with max level items), so that you can INCREASE your chances of earning higher quality loot/future cosmetics in the 1.1 update

- If you're currently out of friends or co-op partners, I STRONGLY ADVISE using a Discord server such as Squirrel Squad or Blood Moon Inn to find players to play with

- Sadly, the game currently has a ""meta"" where certain class/weapon combinations are better than most, you can try what you like, but for those interested, right now (1.0.8.1 patch LIVE), most classes are useful with the exception of Sienna's Battle Wizard that suffers from badly designed class mechanics.

- Performance may vary. The game has exceptional issues and a very intrusive Anti-Cheat system that will use up PC resources during play time. Understand that the DX12 version isn't optimized properly yet, so if you don't have a modern PC, use DX11 for best performance (NOT graphical). You can switch Shadows and other optionals (such as High Quality Fur) OFF, since you won't gain that much of a visual benefit, as much as you'll get a nasty performance dip. 

REMEMBER: The game is VERY CPU intensive. If you have a weak CPU, I suggest going into the Launcher > Settings and changing the Worker Threads to 3 or 4 just to be safe. Also, if you want EASY games and have a BAD CPU, just host a game and you'll have an easier time since ALL ENEMIES use real time scripts that take up a lot of CPU power for the purposes of calculating pathing, behavior etc.

You can spend hours in it immersing youself with the world and you role in it. The areas are all very well designed and the makers of Destiny 2 are great at making you feel very small in this world by creating huge areas.
But also the small things like weapons, armors, vehicles or just small details scattered around the planets are just perfectly fit.
And i´m sure most have already heard of the great feel of the weapons - it´s no lie! They feel just gorgeous!
Why no higher rate then?
Well, first of all, most things you do (especially in the later DLCs) are highly grindy or simply repetitive. Take Shadowkeep for instance. You have to kill (6?) bosses for the story to advance. And each and every time you need to go to an area, do X, kill boss. And yes, without anything special in between those mission besides turning it back in, reading 2 lines and heading out again. That´s just plain bad!
Also: the later DLCs tend to not tell the full story. If you don´t have the time to raid (this can take a long time, sadly) you will simply not finish the story and are left out.
Sure, you could go to youtube but that´s not the aim of a game, when i bought it.

Basically, if you´re resistant to grind and have the time to raid (or simply don´t care for story): get it!

It has beatiful graphics and an amazing atmosphere. So I bought this game on the release date on PC, I never played it on console or something and I was always hoping that it is coming to PC. So I got an quite powerful PC with an RTX 2070 and an i7-9700k and I am playing on 1440p with my personal settings (ranging from medium to Ultra) on about 55-75 fps. (Average about 65 fps) I really like the combat and gameplay. I got about 180 hrs in this game. Everybody is always talking about having to have a powerful rig. I think you should have a decent rig to play this game and find your own settings that will satisfy in looks and performance. It took me about an month from going setting to setting to find the perfect sweet spot. It took me about 70 hrs of gameplay to play the story and it was very entertaining. My other 110 hrs of gameplay is in the online mode and here are coming my critics. So at this point I am about lvl 90 and got every role and basically everything in the game, except all the things that you have to buy with gold. So online is very glitchy and it very often had me rage quit the game. I don´t know if this applies to anybody else but I have some sort of sound glitch when I join the game and it still hasn´t been fixed and it does not have to do anything with my settings or PC. And another big critical point is just rockstar games. They do nothing right at the moment or in general. They do not listen to their community and don´t fix stuff. Rockstar games is taking the money and puts out very small and useless updates. Atm the playerbase is skyrockiting down beacause they don´t listen to their community and are waiting too long for their updates. And also the players in rdo are not as toxic as the players in GTA V.

Many of these hexes have either enemies or special events on the board. These often require a stat check to complete and can be extremely powerful or deadly. The three characters that one or multiple player can control can act independently, but they will often want to stay in the same zone for battles. Players aren’t the only ones who can call in their allies to help in a battle. Monsters are able to fight alongside other monsters in the world nearby. This can be counteracted through an ambush, which will attack only the monsters that the player moved onto. While in battle, a character’s skills are determined by the weapon they have. Weapons have to roll dice and do damage based upon the amount of successful dice rolls. Dice rolls can have individual dies changed before a roll to a successful roll using the focus resource. The graphics are medium-poly and look stylistic and works well for the game. The sound design is great. The music and sound effects are both amazing. ",80

- The world of Sea of Thieves is beautiful. Sailing across the (beautifully rendered) open ocean is a blast in the first few hours of the game. You will encounter storms, reefs, small and big islands, a kraken (if you're lucky) and, of course, others Pirate Ships.

- Pepper enemy ships with cannonball or shoot your friend directly at them, ram their ship, board them or use black powder keg to sink them. There are many ways for you to win a battle against others Pirates. With every player having access to the same weapons and ships, there is no unfair advantage in Sea of Thieves.

- The ""meat"" of the game however is your crew. Sea of Thieves is a good sandbox, but any sandbox is only as fun as the friends you're with.

The Bad :

- Right from the start, the game hit you with a ridiculous design choice : the character ""creator"". In Sea of Thieves, the character creator has been replaced by a character selector. The game display eight randomly-generated characters for you to choose from and if none of them suits you, you can ask for eight new randomly-generated ones. Want a black-haired girl that doesn't look like a car-crash victim ? Good luck to you, you might be here for a while !

- The islands are almost entirely lifeless. You can see them all in about a day of play, and they almost never house anything interesting other than your quest objective. The outposts are the only place you will ever encounter any friendly NPCs and each of those outpost offers you the exact same buildings and the same nine NPCs. They don't move from their spot, they don't interact with each other, and they only offer you a few lines of dialogue. And if you ever see another player in one of those outpost, he will probably try to kill you on sight.

- The combat system is simplistic with only three guns, no cover system (not even crouch), and with a cutlass that can only hit or block. 

- Sneaking onto an enemy ship is practically impossible. Every time a player go to far from his ship, a Siren appears near him, effectively revealing his position. Sometimes, the game itself will transport you back to your ship without even asking.

The Evil :

- All three factions feel the same with nearly identical, radiant fetch quests that have you go to X island to get X thing and return without sinking/dying.

- Enemy variety is almost non-existent, skeletons, snakes and an ""endgame boss"" kraken that has already been turned into a meme by players, as the thing is just tentacles with no actual body lurking under the water.

- Progression is entirely cosmetic and while you can change your ship’s sails and paint, there are fundamentally still only two kinds of ships in this entire pirate game. If the only progression in a game is cosmetic, you should be allowed to change more than just the color of your ship ! ",40

setting. So, what sets this one apart from hundreds of other early access
survival games? Well, this is THE SURVIVAL game. This game gives you so
much information that one may think it is unnecessary,but it is
necessary. That is what makes this game so unique and so addictive.

Eat your Vitamins!
As I said this game is probably the most realistic game ever. When you
hit your metabolism info tab, the games gives you so much information
that it might be daunting at first.

You have info about your heart rate, oxygen, blood pressure, internal
and external body temperature, your BMI and last, but definitely not
least vitamins and minerals! You have pretty much all of them, from
your standard vitamins to minerals such as Sodium and Iron, it’s all
there. You have about 20-30 vitamins and minerals you have to keep
track of!

Like I said this may be daunting, but once you play the game for a bit you
will see how this is necessary. The game is designed to be a hardcore
survival game. When you eat food, you must make sure you are eating
the right food to stay healthy and get enough calories. You ate too many
calories? Then make sure you walk, run and travel long distances to burn
those extra calories. You are planning on travelling long distances? Then
make sure you have some water to quench your thirst and DO NOT
forget to take some weapons to stay safe.

STAY ALIVE!
Right now there might not be a full game but trying to stay alive is a
game in and of itself. You have to maintain your bodily functions by
making sure you poop and pee regularly (and healthily). You have to
make sure you don’t get any diseases and if you see any symptoms, you
have to try and identify the disease and find a cure by yourself. Oh, and
be careful, if you are desperate and turn to cannibalism then you will get
the same infections and diseases as the person before you.

Why Though?
Right now the game is still in early access and it can be about 6 months
to a more complete product. As a result, the game right now doesn’t
have a lot of stuff you absolutely HAVE to do, but there is a lot of stuff
you can do. This game is still more proof of concept than a proper game.
There are no quests and missions yet and more importantly there is no
base building and social infrastructure yet. But there is a proper
hardcore survival sim here.

Cut To the Chase, is it Worth Buying?
In short, I would say yes. This game is getting updates and the devs are
working endlessly to get the full game out. Right now they have a very
good gameplay system and even trying to survive for a period of time is
a test. Right now the game is quite cheap at only $20, but as the game
gets closer to full release expect the price to increase. Expect the game
to come out very soon and I definitely have seen enough to have faith in
the developers. If you are hungry for a true survival game and are willing
to expect a few crashes now for a better game tomorrow (and not to
mention the better price now than later) then this is definitely worth
purchasing.

The point can be captured only if the player’s units are inside a zone, and there mustn’t be any unit of the enemy in the same area.
You have to attack the enemy’s unit to capture the whole area, and the items present there. Units can occupy public buildings, and they can use it as their temporary area. You will get an extensive collection of guns, grenades, armors, daggers, and other items in the game. If we talk about the weather condition, it has been shown the blood-freezing cold weather.

L'univers est très bien retranscrit, les graphismes sont plutôt bien réalisés, et les combats sont vraiment dynamiques.

Il manque quelques petites choses pour vraiment apprécier ce jeu, je trouve ( pour ma part ) qu'il manque des choses quant à la spécialisation de notre avatar ( je parle pour les jutsus ).

En effet, a la Ultimate Ninja Storm, le personnage dispose de 2 jutsus ""de base"" et d'un jutsu dit ""secret"". Sachant qu'il y'a 4 types de jeu qui sont Attaque, Distance, Défense et Soigneur. Je trouve que cela fait un peu léger, et le fait de ne jouer qu'avec ces 3 techniques rends les combats assez répétitifs, et réduit les chances de vous démarquer des autres joueurs. Encore une fois ce n'est que mon point de vue.

Le jeu est très principalement PVP. C'est la source principale d'xp, si je ne dis pas de bêtises ! Les combats se font a 4 contre 4, avec différents enjeux comme capture de base ou encore match a mort, a la call of ! A vous de créer vos synergies avec les différents membres de votre équipe.

Un système de maître assez complet, qui vous permet de choisir un mentors parmi les personnages les plus emblématiques de l'animé, qui vous apprendront leur techniques au fur et a mesure que vous gagnerez de l’expérience dans la formation qu'ils vous enseigneront. 

Notez que vous avez accès a un mode solo, qui n'est autre qu'un enchaînement de missions a faire avec votre maître, ou alors en coop,avec d'autres apprentis ninja :) C'est ce mode qui permet de déverrouiller les différents mentors au fur et a mesure que vous accomplirez es missions qui vous sont confiées. 

Voila donc un opus assez intéressant, plein de bonnes choses, mais comme tout jeu a sa sortie, encore améliorable ;) ",80

Ikit Claw's campaign is without a doubt the most fun i have had with the Skaven. This DLC adds some sorely needed ranged units to the Skaven, with the Rattling Gunners shining through the most. His forbidden workshop combined with the addition of doomrockets, makes Ikit Claw and Clan Skryre an aboslute powerhouse - would recommend to everyone.

Tehenauin and The Cult of Sotek seems a little lackluster compared to Ikit, but is still a strong LL. The campaign mechanics are fine for lizardmen, but nothing game breaking. The beginning of this campaign is also really tough. Having that said; who does not want laser shooting dinosaurs.

This is definately one of my favourite games of all time.When the game launched it was really one of a kind.The characters,the mechanics of the game,the atmosphere and the graphics.
Everything is spectacular.
The game as an idea is totally awesome.I mean,who wouldn't want to control real-time legendary fights between ancient warriors.
For Honor offers many characters for you to choose what suits your playstyle the most.
It's a really fun game to play with your friends when you're way better than them since it feels awesome to hear them cry when you stab them in the foot with your Gladiator!
The game is still alive after all these years..Its community is much smaller now than before but there are still people that are enjoying themselves playing it.
Regular updates are a thing.There is always new content coming up.By saying new content i mean new characters to play cause as far as the events and gamemodes are concerned,your options are really limited.
On the other side of the spectrum though,the game is owned by Ubisoft and this tells us a lot.
It's a great game idea as i said before but the balance between the game characters is ridiculous.Some characters are way op and some others are just dogshit if you can't actually handle them like a pro.
In conclusion,For Honor is an awesome game to play and have fun,but it's also a game that would easily make you throw your keyboard at a wall and make you atheist.I would recommend you to buy it only because it offers a unique experience that no other game of its genre can actually offer you right now.

Der Killer an sich ist sehr interessant. Er ist der Erste mit einer Waffe, die wirklich auf Long-Range Überlebende treffen (und an sich heranziehen) kann. Seine fast komplett dunkele Kleidung lässt ihn ziemlich unauffällig über die Map schlendern. 

Allerdings gibt es auch viele Makos :

Das Schießen seiner Waffe ist sehr laut und kann aus sehr weiter Entfernung gehört werden, was den Überlebenden einen Vorteil verschafft, da sie dann wissen, wo er sich aufhält. 
Außerdem dauert das Nachladen seiner Waffe einfach zu lange. Überlebende können in der Zeit meistens ohne Probleme ihren nächsten Schritt planen.

Man kann sich in die Lage des eigens erschaffenen Reiches setzen und dessen Geschichte Schreiben. Gut, das kann man natürlich auch ohne dieses DLC, aber für alle die sehr viel Spaß an diesem Paradox Meisterwerk haben, sollte bei diesem Angebot zuschlagen.
Vom Gründen einer Militärallianz über eine Forschungsvereinigung sind nämlich allerhand Neuerungen ins Spiel gekommen. Diese Erweiterung kam mit dem 2.6 Patch raus, welcher an sich schon eine Menge Neuerungen in die Galaktische Gemeinschaft von Stellaris bringt.
Hierzu muss ich leider Sagen, das Paradox es sehr Uneinsichtig gemacht hat, welche Neuerungen mit Patch und welche mit DLC kamen.

Fazit: Wer ein sehr großer Fan diese Interstellaren Epos ist, der sollte zuschlagen, denn die neuen Möglichkeiten der Förderationsgründung machen wirklich Sinn, Spaß und geben den Spielverlauf super Möglichkeiten sich selbst weiter zu entwickeln (Es sei zu erwähnen, das ich kein Fan von Allianzen und Bündnissen sämtlicher Art war, bis dieses DLC raus kam).

This game takes on a Norse setting and theme with army contingent being Viking-like, as are the appearances of the buildings and other structures that you build in the game.

*More Casual or Dumbed-Down?*
The thing this game does different from other games in the genre is that, it removes some of the hardcore mechanics such as, having to have roads connecting buildings and instead this game gives you specific locations to build certain buildings. This ensures that newer players don’t mess up their city design and are eased into the genre. 

The game has a story mode with an interesting story, as well as online and co-op modes to build cities with your friends. The story follows some Vikings, who after years of searching for a new home find a suitable location and that is where you take control of the group of survivors. You are not only tasked with setting-up a new home you also have to ensure the clan can thrive and grow in this uncharted area. 

*Art Design and Viking Horns*
The art design for the game is stunning. The graphics are also up to par with modern standards. But let me explain why the art style is nearly perfect for this game. The art style gives the game a slightly cartoon-y feel without making it too casual. This one aspect of the game makes it feel very welcoming and open to new players without shunning away hardcore fans. Along with the art design, the music choice and sound design compliments the art in the game perfectly. These 2 aspects of the game elevate the game to a whole new level.

*Better than the Older Games?*
Sadly, while I can recommend this game to everyone, I can’t say it is better than the older games in this niche genre. But I can say this is the right game for this generation of gamers compared to the older ones. Some may say this is a downgrade, but in my opinion it is just designed for the modern market. Definitely worth picking up, but fans of games such as the Settlers series might have to manage their expectations.

Si j’ai quitté le confort de mon canapé, avec bon nombre de console, des années durant, pour m’orienter vers l’univers de l’ordinateur, c’est pour avoir enfin la possibilité de jouer aux jeux de gestions, qui regorge plutôt sur cette plateforme, ce qui est le cas présentement de House Flipper. 

Je ne sais pas pourquoi lui précisément, peut-être pour me sentir un peu dans la peau à la fois de Valérie Damidot et de Stéphane Plaza, parce que oui, il y a de ça. 

En début de partie, je me familiarise avec le clavier/souris et je lance quelques missions, un peu en guise de tuto puisque très vite, je me rends compte qu’elles n’ont pas un grand intérêt. Alors, je me tourne vers l’achat, la rénovation et la revente immobilière. Ce que je constate rapidement, c’est que l’argent coule très vite à flot, simplement, sans grand effort.

Côté gameplay, c’est fun, on décore comme bon nous semble, on casse un mur pour agrandir une pièce, on achète et installe de nouveaux objets (avec cependant un catalogue quelque peu léger), on répare une prise électrique défectueuse, on pose un nouveau plancher tout neuf, où un revêtement mural, bref, on rénove, on embellit, et c’est vraiment cool jusqu’à ce que, finalement, la monotonie du gameplay ne finisse par tôt ou tard prendre le dessus. 

Pour la durée de vie, les développeurs ont prévu beaucoup de maisons dans lesquelles bosser, offrant une excellente durée de vie, surtout avec l’arrivé du DLC (payant) Garden Flipper, permettant de s’occuper désormais des extérieurs en plus des intérieurs...

First of all: I know this is a common complaint, and yes, it is short, but hey, the original one and Resident Evil 2 weren't that much longer, either, so I don't really see a problem with this. It's a fun return to a classic, but at the same time it manages to stay fresh and even enhance the 1999 version with some new directions.

Granted, it might not be as surprising as the RE2 Remake, and uses basically the same survival horror formula, but I think fans like myself will love it. There's horror, action, an exciting story, characters to cheer for, and a badass enemy following you around - pure, authentic RE experience!

Το Assassin's Creed Rogue είναι ένα πάρα πολύ ενδιαφέρον παιχνίδι και πόσο μάλλον σε αυτούς που έχουν βαρεθεί την σειρά. Καλύπτεται από μια καινούργια ιστορία και μπορώ να πω ότι είναι πολύ δελεαστική και ενδιαφέρον. Εκτός από την καινοτομία της ιστορίας που σε καμιά περίπτωση, δεν θα σε κάνει να βλέπεις τους Assassins σαν εχθρούς, τα γραφικά σε αφήνουν λίγο πίσω, χωρίς αυτό να σου χαλάει την όλη εμπειρία, που από μια φάση και μετά, ξεχνάς εντελώς ότι είναι παλιά. 

Στον ήχο θα έλεγα ότι είναι άνω του μετρίου, με τα soundtrack να ""δίνουν"" έναν επικό τόνο στο παιχνίδι, και πόσο μάλλον με το main saoundtrack που σε συνεπαίρνει.

Επίσης αν δεν έχετε παίξει τα παλιά παιχνίδια δεν θα το πρότεινα. Για όσους το σκέφτονται, τότε είναι σίγουρη αγορά.

Es increible como un juego de la vieja escuela pueda volver a hacer historia en los tiempos que acorden, donde los videojugadores valoran mas los graficos, la violencia, y el componente online sobre todo lo extraordinario que ofrecen juegos como este.

Resident Evil 2 es un juego que nadie se deberia perder, si bien se de antemano que no es para todo el mundo, es un juego estresante, agobiante y sobre todo dificil; es para aquellas personas que valoran un reto sobre otras cosas, por supuesto, un survival horror con todas las letras. Y espero que Capcom entienda de una vez por todas que este es el camino a seguir, no solo haciendo remakes, sino nuevos juegos de la saga Resident Evil o de otras sagas muertas, o incluso nuevas, pero de esta manera, sin abusos contra los jugadores, y con una dosis impresionante de creatividad.

Tan solo me queda decir ¡Bienvenido de nuevo Resident Evil! Y espero que esto genere una nueva ola en juegos Survival Horror de este estilo, que ya lo veníamos necesitando desde hace mucho tiempo.

The game has massive levels in the campaign but only is eight missions long. Each mission allows you to play any way you want at your own pace which is useful for planning your next move. Cooperation mode returns as long as a multiplayer mode with a returning mode from the third game called survival.

Gameplay: 
The game has a became a more realistic sniper game with a few new additions. The game now has a new special ammo that is silenced ammo meaning, the bullets are silenced instead of making a sound when ejected from the chamber. Authentic difficulty has become an even bigger challenge than its previous installments as you have to worry about wind, gravity, muzzle velocity, and resources. It feels like a more realistic sniper game and it becomes satisfying when getting a kill from long distances. Coop mode is back and it feels more enjoyable with a friend as you both can be a pesk to those Nazis and work as a pair to get the missions done faster. Multiplayer has also returned but feels blank due to some game mods except one where you have to kill each player at a certain distance almost like sniper versus sniper. Survival is well survival but with a twist. You hold an area and in that area, Nazis can shut off your resupply location and it does not turn back on for a few rounds,

Story: 
Karl Fairbourne is sent into World War 2 Italy where the Nazis have a new secret weapon and he must eliminate the ones responsible and uncover the weapon fr the Allies. It's actually a complex story that also involves OSS and the Sicilian Mafia with Nazis also causing a conundrum due to the fact that this weapon is dangerus and they want to keep it secret.

Overall Score: 
This game gets an 9/10 because of the authentic difficulty and the coop mode giving the game a new way to play.",90

But it is clear that the developpers didn't spend enough time to make the game stable and without any bugs. 
Major Bug: The most frustrating thing during the game is that when there are several people playing and one of them quits the game, an AI takes his place. Right after that, there is always someone looking to trade with the AI, and this is where the issues begin. The AI accepts to make unfair deals and the player trading with the AI can easily spend like 20-30 minutes to make deals until the AI has nothing, even money. The trade time appears to be unlimited and the AI sells everything at low prices to one player who repeats the trade over and over. Example: the AI has lot of money and cards he got from the real player who left. After half an hour of trades, the AI looses everything to one player.
Minor bug: when dices are thrown, while rolling, they look like they're possesed by a demon or trembling in convulsions instead of rolling normally.
Another minor bug: the game takes a bit too long to load, even on a powerfull computer. As if I was loading Crysis.
I would give 90/100 if there was no major bug like I described. In fact, it should be easy to fix this. But at this state, it doesn't deserve more than 10/100.",10

Jegliche Definition, die ein ""Spiel"" mit sich bringt, raubt Bandai gänzlich durch folgende Dinge, die direkt in's Auge stechen neben zahlreichen anderen Dingen, wo man sich zwar an den Kopf fasst, aber was einem nicht weiter stört, da man diese Art der Blödheit völlig gewohnt ist, aber Bandai hat sich hier wieder was geleistet mit diesen DLC und den zwei anderen, wo mir nur Gift und Galle wegbleibt - zumal es deutlich beweist, dass die Entwickler den Anime nicht einmal gänzlich gesehen haben bzw. ihn zumindest gänzlich kennen - traurigerweise.

Die Quest-Inhalte des DLCs kann Ich nicht einsehen, da die Quests definitiv zu schwer sind für jemanden, der gerade mal die Hauptquest durch hat, Level 80 erreicht hat (eine Level-Cap. mitten im Fortschrittsprozess um das Besserwerden auf Tastenkloppen gänzlich zu reduzieren? Dumme Arschlöcher) und sich über die lächerliche Einfachkeit des Hauptspiels wundert. Wenn man meinen Lieblingsanime zum Kommerz (das echte Spiel ist in den 3 DLC-Packs - das Hauptspiel ist nur 'ne Kurzversion von Xeno 1 + DLCs mit minimalen Neuheiten) so derartig ausnutzt und missbraucht, dann hört der Spaß auf und erst Recht das Spiel (bereits deinstalliert). Mit Methoden wie 30-Anläufe, immer ordentlich viel Heilungs-Items dabei usw. würde es vermutlich nach 3 Tagen der Frustration klappen, aber ganz ehrlich; es fallen vorher schon enorm viele Dinge auf, die einfach störend sind, also das Engagement die Inhalte überhaupt noch sehen zu wollen ist quasi auf 0 gesunken. Ärgerlich zwar um das Geld, aber was soll's...

Der Online-Modus ist - wie selbstverständlich erwartet - kaum bis gar nicht benutzt (hat KEINER der X Mitarbeiter bei Bandai vorher gewusst - der Großteil der Spieler schon) oder es befinden die spielen alle irgendwas, was nichts mit Haupt-, Neben-, Raid-, Experten- oder Event-Quests zutun hat - keine Ahnung, aber der Versuch zur Hunter-Nachmache (Monster Hunter, Dauntless etc.) ist niedlich - auf spöttische Weise natürlich.

Die Charaktere haben KEINERLEI authentischen Bezug zum Anime... Der Ultra-Instinkt z.B. ist völlig auf KI und Super-Hit-Skills gemoddet, was aber völlig den Eigenschaften von diesem Modus widersprechen und auch allem, was Whis und alle anderen Kaios, Götter und whoever sagten und der Ultra-Instinkt ist auch wieder nur eins von vielen Beispielen. 

Wo bleibt denn der SSJ4? Wieso denn kein Ultra-Instinct für den eigenen Character (zumindest unvollständigen Ultra-Instinct hätten sie uns geben können, aber die müssen ja für Xeno 3 und weitere 5 DLC-Packs in den nächsten 2 Jahren planen... Kommerz-Affen!) oder dass der SSB im DLC drin ist statt im Hauptspiel?

Auch ist das Spiel (somit auch dieses DLC hier) nicht für Tastaturen gemacht und wurde auch völlig mühelos überdacht. Bei Zamasu z.B. soll man ellenlange Tastenkombis runterkloppen und wer öfters mit Maus und Tastatur zockt und dann noch solche Action-Kampfspiele kennt, der weiß, dass man das knicken kann und dass ein Controller fast (gibt sicher 3-4 PC-Spieler, die es hingekriegt haben nach 600h haha) schon eine Nutzungsbedingung ist, könnte man ruhig mal irgendwo drauf schreiben, dann hätte Ich es gar nicht erst gekauft und die endlosen Stunden der Wut und Verzweiflung über Bandai's Inkompetenz (nicht einmal Dein Body macht 'ne smoothe Rotation, was einfach nur peinlich ist... Drehst Dich in solchen 45° Animationen wie bei 1995er Arcades)

Das Tutorial vom ältesten Kaio ist auch nur überflüssig in die Länge gezogen...
Dieses Spiel und vorallem das DLC hier bieten keinerlei relevante Inhalte und es wird alles nur ewig lang gestreckt damit der Spieler zumindest glaubt er würde da die dicksten Karriereinhalte durchspielen, die man durchgrinden könnte statt nur 2Kämpfe mit 14 Dialogen und Minisketches, die man zum Glück aber skippen kann, wenn man will oder wenn gerade mal wieder so Attentäter-Laune in Dir herrscht, lmfao... :D",40

You can play in both
single-player and multiplayer. The base game offers you 7 themed
courses with 18 holes each. The game lets you host your own servers or
join other players through a server browser. But the best feature above
all has to be, the workshop support letting you make your own maps and
courses as well, as playing on courses designed by members of the
community.

Fun Only With Friends?
This game may be called Golf With Your Friends, but don’t let that deter
you. This game lets you check out everything in single-player and, if you
are still looking for a more social experience, open the server browser
and join some lobbies. The game also lets you customise the game
experience however you want! When you setup a lobby, you can change
many, many variables. You can have a low gravity setting or if you want
to mess with everyone else you can have the ball be a cube instead! The
possibilities are endless!

Customise To Your Heart’s Content!
As I have already touched upon, this game offers you a lot of
customisation. From the variables that affect gameplay to cosmetics, it’s
all there! You can even do things such as, change the colour of your golf
ball, add a hat and even skins just so that you can stick out in a round of
mini-golf with your friends.

But where the customisation shines in this game has to be, the
workshop. If you get bored of the 100+ holes available in this game, then
why not take a shot at making your own course with funky features and
unique mechanics? Heck, if you think it’s good why not make it public

Party Night!
We have all had those weekends where we play some game with a
group of friends for hours on end, not to be competitive or anything but
just to have fun. So why not check out this fun, little game even if it is a
bit niche. For those that have been gaming for a long period of time
might be reminded of those old browser flash golf games, when they
play this. It’s a very cheap game even at max price and there aren’t
really any issues to not get it. If you are able to get it with some friends,
then even better, but that isn’t a necessity to enjoy this wonderful game.

Le jeu part d'un bon concept bien que totalement fan service (mais bon , qui na jamais voulue voir des combats goku vs luffy par ex ^^) , mais est-il bien exploité ?

Le fan service est bien au rdv avec plus de 40 personnages jouables , mais le reste beaucoup moins. Le mode histoire présente aucun intérêt c'est à peine si on le remarque , son seul but consiste à vous faire souffrir avec des dialogues / cinématiques interminable qu'on ne peut pas skip. 

Mais bon , somme nous la pour le scénar ? NON ! mais plus pour la baston , alors que donne ce système de combat. Bhaaaa , il est moyen , il a pour avantage d'avoir une prise en main facile , voir même trop. Il ne demande pas énormément de skill comme Street Fighter ou tekken pour lâcher de gros combo , le système reste trop assister. Et le système de garde lui est aussi robuste qu'un barrage de gilet jaune, il arrête absolument tout et ceci peu donner de combat bien vide contre certain adversaire... 
Si vous cherchez un système complexe vous allez être déçus , mais pour ceux qui veule juste se mettre sur la gueule avec des animations et effets spectaculaires vous n'allez pas être déçus.

Les graphismes sont excellent ainsi que les animations , le seul reproche qu'un peu trouver est que par moment avec certain coup , le jeu peu paraître surcharger d’animation et embrouiller le joueur , hors-ceci rien à redire.

En conclusion , le jeu reste plutôt bon et agréable à jouer , il est idéale pour jouer entre potes. Par contre il n'est pas du tout adapter pour la compétition à l'heure actuel à cause de la simplicité de son système de combat et son histoire est complètement secondaire. Le fan services est présent avec plus de 40 personnage jouable donc un qu'un peu personnaliser . Il mérite l'honorable note de 12/20",60

In this game, you can choose who you start off as, ranging from a measly peasant to a meddling scholar to a high noble. Naturally, if you choose to be a noble, the game will be easier as you will have good standing with various kingdoms/factions, and likewise you won’t have any standing and won’t be treated equally by the lords if you choose to start off as a peasant. You start with a small army, and as the game proceeds, you can choose to invest in more soldiers for your army. 

The game is an RPG in every sense of the word. What you want to do in the game is entirely up to you. You can roam the lands and become a well reputed and wealthy merchant. You can try and usurp the kingdoms of the Calradia and be the only ruler. Your can terrorize the villages and towns as a fearsome bandit captain. You can also join sides with another kingdom and aid them on their journey, or you can just be a mercenary selling their services. The options are limitless, and they are all yours to make. 

The game is a masterpiece. You will get a lot of content to enjoy in this game. The hours will just fly by! The game has a lot of options available to you in how you want to approach the game. This gives the game a lot of replayability. You create your own adventure and make a story through your actions in Calradia. The sequel is also coming out soon, so this will be a great first step into the franchise. The devs are amazing; they have put a lot of love and care into this game. The expansion Napoleonic Wars adds multiplayer to this game. Multiplayer is engaging with so many players in one single battle it is an amazing experience. Most of the time you can keep it casual and have a hilarious conversation with the other players as well. Also, there are people who organise battles that recreate history in game. It is amazing to see them recreate wars of real world in a game like this. At first glance, this game looks underwhelming, but if you give this a chance you will be pleasantly surprised. It is definitely money well spent.

The only negative would be that the graphics are a bit dated. For those of you that really want high quality graphics, this game won’t have much to offer. That being said, the game is still amazing and most people who play the game don’t really mind the graphics. The other issue that some players might have with how the game lacks any real narrative, but it shouldn’t be a problem for most people. The strength of the game lies in making your own story through the numerous options that you always have available to you. 

Whenever I play this game, I get completely immersed and lose track of time! You can enjoy this game endlessly and if you do ever get bored(impossible), then you can always install a few mods to try new experiences. There are wide variety of mods available from simple diplomacy, cosmetic mods to total overhaul mods that can change the setting to that in LOTR or Game of Thrones or Sengoku era Japan. There is something for everyone to be found in the workshop. Even if you aren’t a fan of medieval setting, you can easily add a mod to the game through the workshop that changes the game completely into different which interests you. The game has an active modding community even 8 years after its release. This speaks volumes about how relevant and well-liked the game still is despite its aging looks.

Overall, this is a really good game. It is an iconic and a masterpiece that has gone on to inspire many more games and developers. Right now this game is quite cheap and with the upcoming release of Bannerlord, this is a great place to enter the series, and you are definitely going to enjoy it. 

Improving on the ambitious Mount & Blade, the stand alone expansion is a fantastic medieval RPG deep gameplay, endless replayability, and an active modding community. If you look past the aging graphics, this game has a lot to offer with its rich RPG elements and the sandbox world. The game doesn’t have a central narrative, so if you are looking for that you’ll have to pass up, but the game wouldn’t have been much different with a narrative anyway. 

Seeing how cheap the game is, it’s a highly recommended purchase.",90

physics: I tried to outsmart one level by moving a body that I knew would trigger an ambush but the body dissapeared off my back when I got too far away.
Optional objectives are mandatory to finish a map. Normally I wouldn't mind but when gameplay isn't interesting enough you just want to leave the area once the main job is done but you can't until everything is done.

Unlike the first two in the series the combat is now turn based and unlike the third (divinity 2), isometric rather then 3rd person.

And to be fair all the better for it.

OS is beautiful and intelligent game, with a lot of charm. Its very much story driven and does require a certain amount of player investment in following its intricate plot. Yes there's going to be plenty to read and lots of dialog to get through, but its mostly well written and enjoyable.

The world is incredibly interactive and one can spend an age just messing around with your inventory, crafting and experimenting with the items you find.

One important point to make is that OS does not hold your hand like many modern rpg's, it can at times feels a little overwhelming but with a little bit of reading and some lateral thinking the solution will present itself.
And talking of Solutions, there are often many different ways to achieve most things in the game, so creativity is often encouraged.

OS absolute win for me is the co-op multiplayer, its incredibly fun and entertaining to play with a friend. 
It is however a slow game and although screenshots may bring Diablo comparisons it does not share its pace.

So in summary:

+beautiful specially spell effects 
+fun turn based combat
+awesome co-op
+lots of dialog and story
+very interactive world and items

This game has everything good about the first game plus even more interesting game elements. The biggest addition is the naval combat, which is there in spades. This game is like most other CRPGs where game offers you a chance to make the character you wish and level them up as they progress through the story as well as recruiting allies and teammates.

*Find Yourself!*
This game offers you a chance to create any character you wish. You can make them look however you wish in terms of appearance. You can choose from a variety of classes, you can be a druid or a mage, a wizard or a warrior the choice is wide and it is yours. You can also dual class and be a mix of different classes, for example you can be a battle-mage, a character who is focused on battling with a bit of magic to maybe buff yourself and allies. One thing the game does better than most other games in the genre is that it offers you a LOT of choices, as you level up in terms of new skills and abilities. The game also lets you choose to continue from your save in the first game, if you have played it. You basically take your character and a few decisions from the first game carry over. But fear not, if you haven’t played and are missing out on the story because this game does a good job of catching you up with the events of the previous game. Others have said that not playing the first one didn’t create a huge difference or gaps in story, but they wish that they have had played it, as it is also a great game.

*Best Combat in the Genre?*
I am a huge fan of this genre and out of all the games I must say this is the one. This is a huge compliment because a lot of games don’t do combat right in this genre. This game has real time combat with the ability to pause it. You can also have the AI to control your allies, although as you play more of the game I suggest you take control of them yourself for more precise decisions. This is something that the other games also have, but there is a certain way that combat has been balanced in PoE 2 that it makes everything feel just right without being too difficult to learn. Don’t get me wrong there is a learning curve for the hardcore fans, but the skill floor is quite low to accommodate for newer players of the genre.

*Ship Combat: Good or Bad?*
The answer to that question is - actually both. The naval combat in this game is good but can also be bad at times and that is the only negative thing I have to say about the game. The ship combat initially is quite dull compared to the rest of the game as it takes form in a text-based format. It makes the game feel like the text-based games from 30 years ago but with a lot of RNG. Although there are some elements that are good about it. There are several roles on the ship and you need the right people in the right role to do those jobs. If you have a surgeon firing the canons, then don’t expect to be hitting a lot of the shots. There is also boarding and that is the highlight of the naval combat. The combat scenarios that come up when you are boarding a ship or being boarded yourself are definitely one of the most fun times in this game. I don’t know why exactly but I guess it might be that it is very close quarters combat in a game like this doesn’t happen often.

*Hours and Hours of Content*
This game is definitely worth picking up and it even does a good job of easing newer players into the genre. It has hundreds of hours worth of content and that is just on a single playthrough. This game offers a tonne of re-playability with the option of multiple character with different playstyles.

I recommend you buy this game below the current asking price, preferably when a miracle patch hits the live servers. Unfortunately, FatShark Games has a proven track record of doing things too little, too late, promising development road maps, only to implement changes very late into the game's life cycle.

PRO TIPS:

- Avoid opening any ""Commendation Chests"" (level up reward) you might earn, until you reach Power level 600 (max level, with max level items), so that you can INCREASE your chances of earning higher quality loot/future cosmetics in the 1.1 update

- If you're currently out of friends or co-op partners, I STRONGLY ADVISE using a Discord server such as Squirrel Squad or Blood Moon Inn to find players to play with

- Sadly, the game currently has a ""meta"" where certain class/weapon combinations are better than most, you can try what you like, but for those interested, right now (1.0.8.1 patch LIVE), most classes are useful with the exception of Sienna's Battle Wizard that suffers from badly designed class mechanics.

- Performance may vary. The game has exceptional issues and a very intrusive Anti-Cheat system that will use up PC resources during play time. Understand that the DX12 version isn't optimized properly yet, so if you don't have a modern PC, use DX11 for best performance (NOT graphical). You can switch Shadows and other optionals (such as High Quality Fur) OFF, since you won't gain that much of a visual benefit, as much as you'll get a nasty performance dip. 

REMEMBER: The game is VERY CPU intensive. If you have a weak CPU, I suggest going into the Launcher > Settings and changing the Worker Threads to 3 or 4 just to be safe. Also, if you want EASY games and have a BAD CPU, just host a game and you'll have an easier time since ALL ENEMIES use real time scripts that take up a lot of CPU power for the purposes of calculating pathing, behavior etc.

La historia, si bien simple y clara, se desarrolla a buen ritmo y con giros sin perder de vista las historias personales de los compañeros, que son igual de interesantes y que tienen un impacto en la relación que tienen con el protagonista. La historia es más similar a la de DAO, por lo que es claro que están volviendo a sus raíces. Pero no os engañéis, tiene mucho más micro-historias, dobles verdades y mitología de lo que primeramente se ve. Los escritores han hecho un gran trabajo, especialmente con cierto personaje.

Los personajes son increíbles, mucho mejores que sus antecesores, y con una variedad muy interesante, incluso en gusto por romance, lo que los hace estar mejor construidos y darles un punto más veraz. Los banters entre ellos son diversos, aunque me habría gustado que hubiera más, ya que saltan cada 20min aproximadamente y es mucho tiempo. Los romances con ellos son interesantes, emocionan y divierten. Lo bueno es que tus compañeros pueden enamorarse entre sí si no haces romance con ellos, lo cual añade una profundidad a la historia y a la realidad de la misma (no todos los PJ tienen que estar enamorados del protagonista).

El modo de combate está muy mejorado, es divertido y tiene una cámara táctica como en DA2, lo cual permite dar órdenes a los compañeros de manera más sencilla o, si nos gusta la estrategia, pues más clara. Siguen las combinaciones de poderes entre clases, así como la especialización de la clase del protagonista. Lo bueno de la especialización es que podemos ""probarla"" antes ya que cada compañero es un ejemplo de su clase. (Ejemplo: Cole, Sera y Varric son pícaros; Cole = asesino, Sera = Tempestad, Varric = Artífice).

El ambiente es de los más hermosos y mejores que he visto, están muy detallados y muy conseguidos. Hay lugares donde dan ganas de perderse y quedarse solo observando el lugar. Además, hay mucha variedad: desde páramos helados, a bosques, llanuras, pantanos y desiertos (cada uno de ellos desatando banters al respecto por parte de los compañeros de equipo). Los mapas son abiertos y libres de ser explorados, además de grandes, posiblemente ""The Hinterlands"" (primer mapa) sera el más grande y tedioso de todos.

La música es una delicia, un poco repetitiva en el estilo, pero cuidada y tratada con mimo. Me encanta el cambio de música en Orlais con su toque ""francés"" y las canciones de taverna.

L'univers est très bien retranscrit, les graphismes sont plutôt bien réalisés, et les combats sont vraiment dynamiques.

Il manque quelques petites choses pour vraiment apprécier ce jeu, je trouve ( pour ma part ) qu'il manque des choses quant à la spécialisation de notre avatar ( je parle pour les jutsus ).

En effet, a la Ultimate Ninja Storm, le personnage dispose de 2 jutsus ""de base"" et d'un jutsu dit ""secret"". Sachant qu'il y'a 4 types de jeu qui sont Attaque, Distance, Défense et Soigneur. Je trouve que cela fait un peu léger, et le fait de ne jouer qu'avec ces 3 techniques rends les combats assez répétitifs, et réduit les chances de vous démarquer des autres joueurs. Encore une fois ce n'est que mon point de vue.

Le jeu est très principalement PVP. C'est la source principale d'xp, si je ne dis pas de bêtises ! Les combats se font a 4 contre 4, avec différents enjeux comme capture de base ou encore match a mort, a la call of ! A vous de créer vos synergies avec les différents membres de votre équipe.

Un système de maître assez complet, qui vous permet de choisir un mentors parmi les personnages les plus emblématiques de l'animé, qui vous apprendront leur techniques au fur et a mesure que vous gagnerez de l’expérience dans la formation qu'ils vous enseigneront. 

Notez que vous avez accès a un mode solo, qui n'est autre qu'un enchaînement de missions a faire avec votre maître, ou alors en coop,avec d'autres apprentis ninja :) C'est ce mode qui permet de déverrouiller les différents mentors au fur et a mesure que vous accomplirez es missions qui vous sont confiées.

The game has massive levels in the campaign but only is eight missions long. Each mission allows you to play any way you want at your own pace which is useful for planning your next move. Cooperation mode returns as long as a multiplayer mode with a returning mode from the third game called survival.

Gameplay: 
The game has a became a more realistic sniper game with a few new additions. The game now has a new special ammo that is silenced ammo meaning, the bullets are silenced instead of making a sound when ejected from the chamber. Authentic difficulty has become an even bigger challenge than its previous installments as you have to worry about wind, gravity, muzzle velocity, and resources. It feels like a more realistic sniper game and it becomes satisfying when getting a kill from long distances. Coop mode is back and it feels more enjoyable with a friend as you both can be a pesk to those Nazis and work as a pair to get the missions done faster. Multiplayer has also returned but feels blank due to some game mods except one where you have to kill each player at a certain distance almost like sniper versus sniper. Survival is well survival but with a twist. You hold an area and in that area, Nazis can shut off your resupply location and it does not turn back on for a few rounds,

Story: 
Karl Fairbourne is sent into World War 2 Italy where the Nazis have a new secret weapon and he must eliminate the ones responsible and uncover the weapon fr the Allies. It's actually a complex story that also involves OSS and the Sicilian Mafia with Nazis also causing a conundrum due to the fact that this weapon is dangerus and they want to keep it secret.

The game was first announced in E3 2017 and served as the direct sequel to the 2015 title Ori and the Blind Forest. It finally released on March 11, 2020, for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One and has very positive reviews on Steam.

Gameplay: 
Ori and the Will of the Wisps is the perfect blend of classic Metroidvania games and concise puzzle platforming mechanics. The game picks up almost immediately where the Blind Forest left off. It opens with the birth of Ku, the last offspring of angry-owl boss Kuru. Ku grows and flourishes under the loving care and affection of the white forest spirit Ori and his family. When Ku comes of age, his time to fly is hindered by a damaged wing. Ori patches the weak limb with Kuro’s feather, and the pair take off into an inspiring flight sequence. They follow a group of birds across the ocean into a new land, directly into a mighty thunderstorm, the fury of which separates the pair, plummeting them to the ground in different directions. Lost and alone, Ori searches for Ku bringing the saddest of sequences enough to make a grown man cry.
Compared to Blind Forest, the world is vast, the list of abilities and items Ori can collect is bigger; in addition there is more speaking characters, hence the emotional moments are even deeper. This new world of Nibel becomes your playground to find your owl friend, which looks hand-painted, colourful and chaotic all at the same time. Every inch of the map is designed to test your powers. If a spot seems unreachable, then Ori probably hasn’t acquired the power to get there yet. Ori’s movement controls are remarkable, double jumps along with complex combos of dashing, leaping, vaulting, burrowing & grappling feels as quite natural. These abilities can be used to uncover secret challenges, sidequests and additional power-ups. Just the movement and exploring is gratifying enough that uncovering hidden secrets are just as compelling as following the narrative.
While Blind Forest was a more lonely and contemplative sort of adventure, Wisps’ world is inhabited by chatty creatures eager to aid Ori’s quest or unknowingly sidetrack you from the search. Moki are adorable cat-monkeys; Tokk hangs in the hub world, selling special attack abilities in exchange for shards; Grom is a dwarf who collects ore and adds new decorations to the area. A mysterious wizard in a cave that sells and upgrades spirit shards and unique items that can influence the game, making Ori more powerful. The game also features ancient animals who serve as Ori’s guides, but sometimes obstacles, on their journey. These massive, and dazzling beasts make Ori feel very small, which in turn makes gameplay even more impressive with their exquisite art style.

What’s new? 
Unlike its predecessor, the game now relies on autosaving rather than manually saves in the form of soul links. The older upgrade system is replaced by the shard system that allows players to upgrade Ori in various ways and can be equipped and changed on the fly.

Combat 
The game features combat shrines, specialised areas that challenge players with waves of enemies, that reward Ori with new slots for power-enhancing shards. Although the combat has been enhanced, Ori is still a series that’s more about exploring than battling, so skipping optional battles can be considered based on your taste.

Conclusion: 
Though the game has massive technical woes when it initially launched, the day-one patch solved almost all of it, and the game no longer hangs, or frame drops and all bugs and glitches will undoubtedly be squished in near-future. Nevertheless, the game is worth playing till the end with its bittersweet moments and its gorgeous art style. I extremely recommend it for every platformer puzzler fan ever!",100

In Darksiders 2 you will play as one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Death.

Death, will try to clear his brother War’s name by restore humanity, where War is convicted by destroying it. The story line was interesting and in my opinion it could be better, but in general it’s fine. Even though the world in Darksiders 2 is way bigger than the previous game, but it wasn’t good since there is not that much to explore. I guess the reason is so the can add more side quests and give the game more hours. the game comes with new skill system, where you have two paths, but still can mix each path skill with another. You have Harbinger Tree (Warrior path) and Necromancer Tree (Spellcasting path).

I liked the fact they didn’t make it like the previous game where you can buy your skills, but sill I don’t think it should be that much of skills. War as in the previous game has only four skills and they were perfect as they suite its character, which is the opposite in this game, even though his name is Death, you won’t feel the meaning of his name, except his Reaper form. I fact that you get gold after slaying an enemy when it was a souls in the last game it’s really confusing, since you use them to purchases items from demon called Vulgrim, who mentioned that he have no use of gold in Darksiders 1 and asked for souls as currency. And since we playing with Death, the souls will suit it more.

Weapons system I really didn’t like, in this game they allowed you to use different varieties of weapon; such as, Hummer, Swords, maces and etc, beside Death main weapon Scythe. the problem is unlike the previous game where you can use only War’s sword (Chaoseater), and the more you kill the more Chaoseater become strong and upgraded. In Darksiders 2 the Scythes are not different than other weapons. All these extra thing killed the character, you barley can see him as death. Even his agility, the way he moves, walk on walls doesn’t suit Death. Which makes you wonder how are they gonna deliver Strife character (One of Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse).

The graphics isn’t bad at all, and I hope they won’t change it.

To sum up, the game was a big surprise where there is a huge difference between it and the previous one. Even though they fail to deliver Death character as it should be, you will mostly like and enjoy the fights and the character. the story was great and really interesting. I hope the make the next game more like the first one, more Action than RPG as it suit the story and the characters more.",80

Le jeu part d'un bon concept bien que totalement fan service (mais bon , qui na jamais voulue voir des combats goku vs luffy par ex ^^) , mais est-il bien exploité ?

Le fan service est bien au rdv avec plus de 40 personnages jouables , mais le reste beaucoup moins. Le mode histoire présente aucun intérêt c'est à peine si on le remarque , son seul but consiste à vous faire souffrir avec des dialogues / cinématiques interminable qu'on ne peut pas skip. 

Mais bon , somme nous la pour le scénar ? NON ! mais plus pour la baston , alors que donne ce système de combat. Bhaaaa , il est moyen , il a pour avantage d'avoir une prise en main facile , voir même trop. Il ne demande pas énormément de skill comme Street Fighter ou tekken pour lâcher de gros combo , le système reste trop assister. Et le système de garde lui est aussi robuste qu'un barrage de gilet jaune, il arrête absolument tout et ceci peu donner de combat bien vide contre certain adversaire... 
Si vous cherchez un système complexe vous allez être déçus , mais pour ceux qui veule juste se mettre sur la gueule avec des animations et effets spectaculaires vous n'allez pas être déçus.

Les graphismes sont excellent ainsi que les animations , le seul reproche qu'un peu trouver est que par moment avec certain coup , le jeu peu paraître surcharger d’animation et embrouiller le joueur , hors-ceci rien à redire.

En conclusion , le jeu reste plutôt bon et agréable à jouer , il est idéale pour jouer entre potes. Par contre il n'est pas du tout adapter pour la compétition à l'heure actuel à cause de la simplicité de son système de combat et son histoire est complètement secondaire. Le fan services est présent avec plus de 40 personnage jouable donc un qu'un peu personnaliser . Il mérite l'honorable note de 12/20",60

The grand campaign is sick because the map, despite a few flaws is awesome, and the units are both well made and balanced, especially with mods like Radious installed. The game is way more complex as well, building cities is actually a quite realistic and fun thing to do, and combat has improved a lot, especially combat AI. The AI is actually clever now, aside from a few bugs here and there, but that and all the combat related issues come from the Warscape engine, that dates back to Empire.

Greedfall (suprisingly fitting name *cough*) did what Bioware and Bethesda failed to deliver the recent years, and delivers a 3rd Person Action RPG with clear focus on its story (which I haven't completed yet though) and good gameplay. 

When creating your character, you can pick 3 from classes (Warrior, Mage and Rogue), each with their own strengths and abilities which can be tweaked as you progress through the game.

The side-quests are very entertaining as well and introduce you to a variety of characters, each with their own background and aims, those are pretty much on Bioware/Piranha Byte-level
The characters are voiced really well (English only though) and the actors made a great job in getting in with their roles, whether they are guards, priests, merchants, or peasants.

Gameplay-wise can do basically everything you'd expect from a 'classic-RPG': talk to all sorts of characters as mentioned, interact with our compatriots (you can shape the relationship to them as well), complete quests and explore dungeons to get that sweet loot, trade, craft, fight (also bosses of course), et cetera.

Now while the game doesn't offer one Open World, we instead travel through several larger environments with some very nice details, although you will often come across replicated assets.
Cities feel like like they have been copy/pasted at times because of this asset-recycling and it really starts to annoy me a little bit by now...
And this is where another negative point kicks in: Graphics.

I wish I had a better way to express it, but at times they really look like the game was made in 2013. Textures aren't that sharp in fact it gets really ugly as you close in, most noticably (I'd say at least,) the floor.

On two chairs

Continuation is forged under the auspices of a return to the roots - a kind of universal answer to any questions if it is an old series that was brought back to life. So it was with the ""Cossacks"", so it was with the ""Master of Orion"". True, Orion did receive its dose of necessary changes. That's SpellForce III did not escape them. 

Basically, it's all the same hybrid of real-time strategy and role-playing game. You have a hero, or even a few, who live by all the rules of the RPG. That is, they get experience, new levels, learn skills and change equipment to the one that is more abrupt. With the only proviso that the camera can always be torn from the hero and lift it to the ""RTS"" height.

Here the game is completely different. Heroes are no longer powerful loners: they strictly need the support of other soldiers. Infantry, archers, cavalry - the whole gentleman's set of any strategy. In truth, in SpellForce strategy is something much more than RPG. Properly ""swinging"" the hero is able, of course, to put a pack of enemies and himself, however in a large-scale clash, in which the formations of units become important, their construction and tactics, and not just stupid ""rush"", it is desirable for the hero to take care of himself. The benefit of the character can be dazzled not only by the fighter but also by the masters of support, around which the soldier wakes up with a sword and the horse does not get tired.

Work with the population

At the level of strategy, SpellForce III has changed markedly. Each location is divided into sectors that are subject to capture and retention. They could be called ""control points"" with a stretch, but there is a difference. The sectors do not supply a certain abstract resource, as it was in the series Dawn of War and Company of Heroes, but they live in peasants, civilians, ready to follow your instructions. Muzhichi cannot be added or subtracted, you can not overtake him in another sector, which is easier for you to protect: where a woodcutter was ""registered"", where he will live until the end of the party.

Here the game is already waving at The Settlers, drawing the life of the villages. True, production chains are not here, and they are not needed - in a hybrid game it is extremely important to balance both entities so that they do not overshadow each other. Therefore, the management of the settlements is very simple. You order to build barracks, all sorts of storerooms, distill the inhabitants from one building to another, thus changing the focus of production. And the more sectors-villages you capture, the greater the forces you can roll out against the enemy, well, other capital RTS-truths. Sitting in a corner with one unhappy farm, apparently, there is not a single chance. 

In this case, SpellForce IIIIt does not look like a game capable of knocking out hundreds of warriors. Here and the maps are more like labyrinths, suitable for RPG. Here, there is room for tactics for the company level. More importantly, SpellForce III uses the Line of Sight system, which in the strategies is a rare guest (you could meet it in the same Company of Heroes 2 ). The fog of war in this situation dissipates not all at once, if you get to the field of review of your ""units"", but depending on the terrain. An enemy fighter can take shelter behind the house, and your detachment marches past two steps and does not notice anything. I think in the early stages of online battles this property will be used to the fullest, and in the campaign, he will find a place: a lonely hero who escaped from prison, patrols with a predictable route - well, you understand.

I was especially interested in the balance between the parties to the conflict, of which three are people, elves, and orcs. Mr. Pollis especially stressed that the players reproached SpellForce III for lack of asymmetry, that is, each faction had about a common set of ""units"", but with different appearance and some properties. In the release version of the army will cease to be reflections of each other, which, of course, decorates and diversifies the gameplay. 

If only the asymmetry does not concern the general balance of forces (when one faction is objectively stronger than the other). So often suffer RTS, dependent on the plot, and SpellForce III promises a campaign for 30 hours or more. 

SpellForce IIIit is worth giving a chance, and it is unlikely that it will fail.

Don't buy this game at any given chance, they will backstab you later once all the money is flowing in for 2k.

It has beatiful graphics and an amazing atmosphere. So I bought this game on the release date on PC, I never played it on console or something and I was always hoping that it is coming to PC. So I got an quite powerful PC with an RTX 2070 and an i7-9700k and I am playing on 1440p with my personal settings (ranging from medium to Ultra) on about 55-75 fps. (Average about 65 fps) I really like the combat and gameplay. I got about 180 hrs in this game. Everybody is always talking about having to have a powerful rig. I think you should have a decent rig to play this game and find your own settings that will satisfy in looks and performance. It took me about an month from going setting to setting to find the perfect sweet spot. It took me about 70 hrs of gameplay to play the story and it was very entertaining. My other 110 hrs of gameplay is in the online mode and here are coming my critics. So at this point I am about lvl 90 and got every role and basically everything in the game, except all the things that you have to buy with gold. So online is very glitchy and it very often had me rage quit the game. I don´t know if this applies to anybody else but I have some sort of sound glitch when I join the game and it still hasn´t been fixed and it does not have to do anything with my settings or PC. And another big critical point is just rockstar games. They do nothing right at the moment or in general. They do not listen to their community and don´t fix stuff. Rockstar games is taking the money and puts out very small and useless updates. Atm the playerbase is skyrockiting down beacause they don´t listen to their community and are waiting too long for their updates. And also the players in rdo are not as toxic as the players in GTA V.

It is the fourth game in the Just Cause series and the successor to its 2015 game Just Cause 3. A somewhat similar game to this one is Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Breakpoint. They are the same genre, both are TPS shooter and you will find some similarities in the gameplay.
Just Cause 4 is set in a fictional South American country named Solis, which is home to some extreme weather conditions. The game has been launched at the end of 2018.

Special features
In this game you have a wingsuit which gives you some cool gameplay experience. You can go skydiving, base jumping and free dive with no limits. You will fight your enemies under some extreme weather conditions, including treacherous tornadoes and lighting storms. Also, a special thing in this game is that you can use the extreme weather events to your advantage thanks to the never seen before in-game physics.
The plot takes place after the events of Just Cause 3 when Rico Rodriguez is approached by a Solis native, Mira Morales. She convinces him to come to Solis to uncover the truth about Project Illapa. The projects scope is to create weather cores able to control the weather and create storms. Also, Miguel Rodriguez (Rico’s father) had a part in creating those. The project is run by the incumbent Solis leader Oscar Espinosa. He maintains strict control over the people of Solis. What you need to do is to dive into the South American nation of Solis, the homeland of the Black Hand and search of answers.

Graphics and art design
Even though the game still has some bugs the graphics will make up for it. The art design plus the graphics for this game make a good combination making it look somehow realistic with all the shadows and reflections. Speaking of the art design itself, it is very good giving the game a very tropical feeling.

Better that the Older Games?
This game still needs some improvements. The bugs must be fixed for sure, but after all this is still a good game. I can’t say for sure if this is better than some of the older ones in this series, but if you liked previous JC games, you will like this one for its story and gameplay. In conclusion, I can recommend this game for all TPS and JC lovers.

La trame principale est bien réussie, le monde est une nouvelle fois mis en danger par les supers vilains. Le joueur incarne une multitude d'incroyable supers héros afin de sauver la planète. De plus, il n'y a pas que le mode histoire dans ce jeu ; il existe aussi un mode libre où vous incarnez n'importe quel personnage de l'univers Marvel. Vous pouvez vous promener avec Iron Man volant et tirant des missiles sur tout le monde ou avec tante May, la célèbre tante de Spiderman !

Vous visitez l'île de Manhattan, avec l'ingrédient en plus, qui fait l'île de Marvel ; on peut y trouver la tour Stark, l’Astéroïde M, une base de Hydra abandonnée ainsi que le manoir X.

Les missions dans le jeu sont très bien faites. Il y a de la logique afin de passer les niveaux, beaucoup d'ennemis à battre et pratiquement un boss à vaincre après chaque niveau. Par contre, je trouve que battre les boss est assez ennuyant. C'est souvent la même manière de les vaincre ( je vous laisse voir pas vous même). Mais malgré tout, le jeu est vraiment bien et attractif.

Bien sur il n’existe pas que le mode histoire. Vous pouvez faire des missions secondaires dans le mode libre afin d'avancer dans votre progression et débloquer des personnages. 

Graphiquement, pour un jeu Lego, les graphismes sont très beau, ce n'est bien évidemment pas des graphismes extraordinaires comme les dernières nouveautés mais plutôt des graphismes du style « animé jeux vidéos ». Le jeu est très fluide et il ne demande pas une grande puissance venant de votre ordinateur.

Si vous comptez jouer sur clavier et à la souris à ce jeu, et bien, comment dire ? C'est impossible ; la maniabilité de ce jeu est horrible si vous comptez rester sur clavier. Sur ce genre de jeu, il vaut mieux brancher une manette afin de profiter à 100% du jeu.

En conclusion,ce jeu est, selon moi, très bien pour tout fan de super héro. Ce jeu est attractif et le mode libre avec la multitude de personnages donne beaucoup de charme au jeu. ",90

Here, Batman needs to save the city from Joker once again and stop the evil. Now the question is, is the game good? I would say yes because you play as Batman using stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets for combat and exploration.The further you go in the story, the more gadgets you unlock. 

The game is singleplayer, of course, and has achievements to get in story mode. When you complete missions, you get xp and level up. Leveling up gives you ability points to spend on unlocking stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets. There are also riddles to solve, marked by green question marks around the map. There aren’t many side quests unlike other games in the Arkham series, but it's fine. There might be some bugs, but I did not encounter any bugs in my playthrough. I really enjoyed playing the game and completed story mode in 10 hours. The game has a lot of action; especially near the end, but I won't spoil.The game itself is beautiful with good-looking graphics, especially for a game from 2010. The weather in the game is always dark and rainy, setting up the atmosphere quite nicely. It has great soundtracks and clear sounds which is a really important part of a game.

The combat in the game is pretty simple. You just have to left click to attack and right click to dodge. You can also stun enemies by pressing the scroll button and use gadgets by pressing number keys multiple times. The game also has some exploration puzzles that you need to solve in order to get into some places on the map. You can also occasionally find hidden locations in the game. You can also use the batclaw to travel around the map faster!

Batman: Arkham Asylum has great graphics, good combat, and, most importantly, a good story.

I'd rate this game 10/10 because I really enjoy the Batman Arkham series.

The Valley of the Lost Women 

The setting of the game is simple. The protagonist, sentenced to death by Hyborian, is tied to a cross and left to die in the desert. After being hung briefly, they are suddenly saved by Conan himself; apparently, to somehow justify the name of the game, because the legendary barbarian will never appear again, but before you see the miraculous liberation, the game comes to an abrupt halt for character creation where you can choose your hero’s gender, race, appearance, and religion. After the creation of the hero, you are released into a seamless open world. 

On a note, you can’t help but notice the nature of the editor in character creation. There is an option that allows you to the adjust the size of genitalia and other intimate body parts of the lousily voiced protagonist. While this can be seen as a quirky aspect of the game, with many other things lacking and this only being a catchy superficial detail, it ends up feeling like an attempt to grab more attention. 

There is no tutorial in Conan Exiles. You will have to learn everything through trial and error. In a strict sense of the word, the game has no quests whatsoever. However, there are goals that are shown on the upper right corner of the screen. These help you get acquainted with the basics of the game.

Treasures of Gwalure 

Crafting is an important aspect of the game, and the players will have to mess around with a lot of ingredients for that. At first, it will just be simple materials stones and branches, then you will need rarer resources like: stellar metallic ore, or the blood of a demon. In search of these ingredients, you will have to traverse many beautiful locations - deserts, jungles, snow-covered valleys, swamps, and even a volcano. Unfortunately, the collection of resources is somewhat tiring. Useful materials are hard to find, and instead of getting to admire the scenery of Hyboria, you will mostly be busy cutting down trees, breaking stones, and hunting animals. 

The tools used change what exact resource you will be getting. For instance, if you chop the tree with an axe, there will be some wood, and if you prick the tree with a pick, the bark. The character needs to drink and eat, so as not to die of hunger and thirst. You need to hunt animals for food. And for complete safety, you will want to build a house or even a fortress of your dreams if you are feeling up for it. You can also climb steep cliffs and cook on a bowler hat, something that’s reminiscent of last year’s The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. That’s where you are brought back to ground with naked bodies and a game that doesn’t play at all like BotW.

Religion is an important mechanics in the game. Belonging to the confession provides unique equipment recipes, sacrifices allow you to invoke the huge all-destroying avatar of the chosen god. When you start off, the game lets you worship only one deity, but their numbers can be increased later in the game. I'm not a bore, but where is it seen in Hyboria that the minions of Seth, whose teachings completely contradict each other, simultaneously give praise to the solar miter!

Another notable mechanics of the game, a quite unusual one, is slavery. In order to get yourself a slave, you need to trash the enemy before they lose consciousness, then tie them and make them rotate the wheel of pain. It works the same way as it does in Conan’s film. The system of slavery is needed for proper organization and development of economy. A warrior slave can be made to guard the house, the smith slave will make an improved weapon, and the dancers take care of the filth that can be picked up in the ancient ruins.

All the rascals in the house 

Conan Exiles has several modes - PvP (each player was removed from the cross personally by Conan!), online PvE and a singleplayer campaign. The game is punishing; you can die very quickly. The maximum number of players on a server is 40. Although the true potential of the game is reached in multiplayer, the singleplayer campaign is also good - you can play only for that. 

After you die, experience gained and skills learned do not disappear, but the character literally starts with a bare back and only items in the chests are not lost. That is, of course, if you are not playing the campaign on easy difficulty level. In addition to that, you have to start with character creation every time you join a new server in multiplayer, which is really annoying. 

There have been a number of impressive changes after the release, including, but not limited to, an increase in the number of resources, recipes, and monsters. The devs have also added new animations, deities, and biomes. The game has come really far from when it was first released in early access in early 2017. Taking a year and a half for full release from early access worked for the sandbox survival game Conan Exiles, but there are still some quality of life and game balance issues that need to be fixed. The game doesn’t quite capture the feel of the mystical world of Conan: The Barbarian, so it may be the cause of disappointment for fans of franchise, but it is still a solid survival game. Recommended for fans of survival genre.

Some racing simulations such as the old Superbike games and recent MotoGP offerings have come close, but now there’s a road bike sim that completely raises the bar.
Ride 3, available on PS4, Xbox One and PC, is the Gran Turismo for bikes. Featuring hundreds of bikes from classics to Ducati's new V4 Panigale, you can re-live almost any era you like - whether that’s ragging a Suzuki RGV250 around Oulton Park or mastering the Nurburgring’s Nordschleife on a BMW S1000RR. 
The range of tracks is impressive - 30 to be precise - including biking mecca Cadwell Park, Oulton, Brands Hatch and Donington in the UK, as well as Portimao, Monza, Imola, Vallelunga, Magny Cours, Road America, Sugo and the Nurburgring overseas.
It’s not just track riding either, there are several road courses too, including the North West 200, Ulster Grand Prix and Imatra as well as a number of fictional roads circuits designed to test your ability its just a shame they couldn't add the Isle Of Man TT to there list of tracks and also a few more British tracks so you can have bsb championship. 
The circuits are eerily accurate, the level of graphics games have reached these days is insane – it is almost like you are physically at the circuit you’re racing through your television.
The physics are as good as any bike game gets; the throttle does what you’d expect it do and it's the same for the brakes. You can alter the difficulty for a greater, or easier challenge but the key thing is the bike behaves like a bike should, which has been a huge problem for bike games in the past.
You can edit your livery, tune your bikes to an unbelievable level and career mode takes you through a series of 50 magazines (we appreciate the nod to the media!) featuring different race challenges on different styles of bikes. You can lose hours…
For race fans, there are a number of World Endurance, road racing and BSB bikes available for purchase… so rather than trying to knock ten seconds off your lap time on a Donington trackday you can put yourself on Shane Byrne’s Be Wiser Ducati and try and beat the BSB pole record.

This is definately one of my favourite games of all time.When the game launched it was really one of a kind.The characters,the mechanics of the game,the atmosphere and the graphics.
Everything is spectacular.
The game as an idea is totally awesome.I mean,who wouldn't want to control real-time legendary fights between ancient warriors.
For Honor offers many characters for you to choose what suits your playstyle the most.
It's a really fun game to play with your friends when you're way better than them since it feels awesome to hear them cry when you stab them in the foot with your Gladiator!
The game is still alive after all these years..Its community is much smaller now than before but there are still people that are enjoying themselves playing it.
Regular updates are a thing.There is always new content coming up.By saying new content i mean new characters to play cause as far as the events and gamemodes are concerned,your options are really limited.
On the other side of the spectrum though,the game is owned by Ubisoft and this tells us a lot.
It's a great game idea as i said before but the balance between the game characters is ridiculous.Some characters are way op and some others are just dogshit if you can't actually handle them like a pro.
In conclusion,For Honor is an awesome game to play and have fun,but it's also a game that would easily make you throw your keyboard at a wall and make you atheist.I would recommend you to buy it only because it offers a unique experience that no other game of its genre can actually offer you right now.
Enjoy the game!

Police cars are overpowered but that is to be expected. What is not expected are the demanded millions of points in order to progress further in game. If a player really wants to achieve the completion of the game then that player would need to farm points with numerous exploits published by YTbers (unfortunately the best and most efficient way to get points) longer than actually playing the game.

Aber nicht so schlimm wie der letzte Teil. Das beste am Spiel ist wohl die Lizens der Nfl. Es hat als einziges Spiel die echten Teams. Das Gameplay ist langsamer und etwas(!) angenehmer als im Vorgänger. Heißt das, dass es gut ist? NEIN! Es spielt sich schrecklich. Die Animationen sind furchtbar, was nicht gut ist, da das ganze Gameplay aus Animationen und keiner echten Physik besteht. Durch diese Animationen-Abhänigigkeit folgen Bugs, und Glitches. Um mehr zu sehen einfach mal bei Youtube: ""Sloppy Madden"" oder "" Madden Bugs"" eingeben und man findet sehr viele Videos. Außerdem ist die Grafik nicht mehr Zeitgemäß. Man schaue auf Madden 17 und man sähe keinen Unterschied. Spieler sind hässlich, Fans nicht mal erkennbar, und das liegt nicht an meinem PC und den Grafikeinstellungen. Andere EA Spiele wie Fifa, Battlefield oder sogar ein Need for Speed haben deutlich schönere Grafik. Kommen wir zu den Spielmodi. Es gibt einen Karriere, bzw. Franchise Modus, welcher seit mindestens 3 Jahren der selbe ist. Es gibt einen ""Schnelles-Spiel"" Modus, wo man halt ein Football-Spiel spielt, was bei dem Kaputten Gameplay sich aber garnicht wie Football anfühlt. Es gibt die Große Neuerung, den Face of the Franchise Modus, welcher eine KATASTROPHE ist. Die Story ist langweilig, die Spiele auch und nach gut 1 Stunde ist es auch schon vorbei und man hat eine ganz normale Spieler Karriere. Dann gibt es noch Ultimate Team. Wer neu bei EA-Sport Spielen ist, kann sich über Ultimate Team woanders informieren. Glaub mir, es ist schlecht. Kurzgefasst, entweder bezahlst du für Packs oder du musst 10 Stunden lang immer wieder Spiele spielen gegen 99 ovr Teams. Die neuen X-FACTORS sind komplett OP und reichen nicht als Verkaufsargument aus. Ein weiterer Punkt für Madden ist der Soundtrack, welcher verdammt geil ist, meiner Meinung nach. Aber ich würde die Finger von dem Spiel, bzw. allen EA-SPORTS Games lassen. Vorallem wenn bald das neue Madden rauskommt. Vllt. ist dieses dann reduziert und man denkt sich für nen guten Preis könnte man sich es holen. NEIN, spar dein Geld und mach was sinnvolles damit aber kauf dir NICHT MADDEN 20!!!",20

Comme vous pouvez le voir sur mon profil voilà très longtemps que je n'ai pas fait de review, mais je considère vraiment que ce jeu mérite que je dépoussière mon clavier pour lui.

Sans plus tarder entrons dans le vif du sujet !

----------Point Positif----------

• Rapide à prendre en main : Le jeu en lui même est très simple, donc après une ou deux partie on fini par comprendre très rapidement le fonctionnement des compétences, l'intérêt du marchand ou encore l'utilité des gemmes que l'on récupère.

• Graphisme : Ca c'est purement subjectif mais je trouve que les graphismes sont vraiment sympa, le style un peu cartoonesque n'a rien de dérangeant au contraire ça donne son charme à ce jeu qui a beaucoup de potentiel.

• Gameplay : Certain critiquerons le gameplay qui est trop simpliste car effectivement vous ne possédez que 4 compétences sur chaque champion, cependant à la même manière que Heroes of the storm, a chaque niveau vous aurez un passif à prendre qui ajoutera un effet à une de vos compétences. Qui plus est chaque partit est différente, les améliorations obtenue à chaque lvl sont aléatoire ce qui vous pousse à vous adapter avec ce que vous avez à chaque partie. Ajoutez à cela le fait que vous pourrez bénéficier de certain passif grâce aux gemmes que vous récolterez à chaque fin de parties comme une immunité aux étourdissements, des % d'or en plus etc... 

• Fun entre potes: Vous pourrez créer des parties jusqu'à 4 joueurs, donc autant vous dire que c'est vraiment amusant de jouer avec ses amis, d'autant plus qu'à un certain niveau de difficulté il sera préférable d'avoir une certaine synergie dans les passifs ou les champions que l'on peut choisir.

• Contrôle ajustable : C'est rare de voir ça sur un jeu vidéo, mais il est possible de basculer entre deux modes de jeu possible, soit vous jouer à la manière d'un Diablo en cliquant sur la la map pour vous déplacer et en utilisant AZER pour utiliser vos compétences, soit vous pouvez changer d'option et passer en ZSQD pour vous déplacer, ainsi donc vos compétences se jouerons sur le Click droit, E R et espace, tout en lançant des auto attaques grâce à votre click gauche.

----------Point Négatif----------

• Actuellement le jeu est répétitif : A la manière d'un left 4 dead le but est simple, lancer une partie franchir quelque pallier et tuer un boss, puis recommencez... Ma première partie avec mes amis a duré une heure en difficulté normale, bien sûr il y a deux autres niveau de difficulté qui corsent le jeu mais le principe est le même. (Là aussi les développeurs ont prévu de rajouter des modes de jeu et de nouveaux champions !)

• Prix peut être un peu cher : Voilà c'est en gros un Rogelite à la Left 4 Dead, actuellement ça casse pas trois pattes à un canard on avance d'un point A à un point B puis on recommence donc 20€ à l'heure actuelle c'est peut-être un peu cher même s'il faut le dire, avec des amis le jeu est vraiment fun

----------Conclusion----------

Je conseille ce jeu bien évidemment, mais je conseille de l'acheter sur steam afin de pouvoir se faire rembourser si vous ne l'aimez pas. Parce qu'actuellement le jeu n'a pas une réduction assez significative pour prendre le risque de l'acheter à l'aveuglette selon moi. Malgré que le jeu soit sortie récemment (hier le 23/09/2020) sous sa version 1.0 tout comme Northgard le jeu sera soumis à des améliorations au fil du temps, les développeurs Shiro Games ne le laisserons pas pourrir surtout au vu de son potentiel.

Je sais également que j'ai habitué les gens à mettre plus de point négatif dans mes review, en général j'essaie de m'en tenir à 5 points positifs pour 5 négatifs mais pour Darksburg je ne peut tout simplement pas, j'ai plusieurs centaines d'heure sur le jeu et malgré ça je prend toujours plaisir à continuer de jouer avec mes amis sur ce jeu, alors on peut certes lui reprocher plein de chose comme sa répétitivité comme j'ai pu le faire, mais en soit même ça c'est quelque chose de normal dans un Roguelite, le genre veut ça et quelque part c'est très bien pour des games chill. 

J'ajouterais même que je me suis forcé à lui trouver des points négatifs, parce que je ne regrette absolument pas mes 20€, la répétitivité ne me dérange absolument pas, donc j'ai rien redire sur le jeu il correspond en tout points à mes attentes j'ai simplement essayé de me mettre à la place d'une personne qui ne connait pas trop le genre des Roguelite

Je ne sais pas quoi ajouter de plus alors pour ceux qui souhaiterais avoir plus d'information concernant Darksburg ou qui aimerait me rejoindre, j'ai créer un discord juste pour ça https://discord.gg/CXcGq3h",80

Warhammer universe. This is not to be confused with the Total War
game ventures into the universe, as those are real time strategy games
unlike this. This game is in fact one of the few Grand Strategy, 4X games
in the Warhammer universe and I must say, it definitely matches the
outstandingly positive standards set by the Total War games. This game
offers you a full campaign with you taking charge of all four factions
available, a co-op mode, multiplayer and a custom match mode where
you can play vs the computer.

Which Faction Will You Draw Power From?
The game offers you the choice of 4 distinct factions. You can choose
from the Space Marines, the Astra Militarium, the Orks or the Necrons. I
will talk about each of these factions in brief.

The Space Marines are pretty much, the human race. They are extremely
well trained and well armed with high-tech weapons.

The Astra Militarium are an alien empire, they consist of a large number
of supporters and while they are loyal, they are also prone to fleeing
from high pressure situations. They are strong in numbers but are
weaker 1v1.

The Orks are a tanky alien race. They are very sturdy and tough to kill. As
you may have guessed the name is a hint to the traditional fantasy race
of Orcs and are very similar to them.

The Necrons are an ancient race that have futuristic tech and vehicles.
Not much is known about these guys, except that they can be very
deadly to face.

Research, Research And More Research!
The game is very similar to other grand strategy games. You have 4
resources to gather and you spend them to build more structures, get
more units to either fight or gather resources, research tech upgrades
etc. One thing that I must commend is the immense care taken in
designing the tech tree of each race. You have several tiers to the tree
and each tier has about 5 upgrades. You must research at least 2 to
reach the next tier. Some buildings require certain tech upgrades as do
certain units. Each faction has its own unique tech tree as well.

While we are still on the topic of gameplay let’s talk about the campaign
missions. The campaign offers you mission after mission in enemy
territory, till you eventually wipe out all the enemy factions. The game
does offer some amount of diplomacy, but the odds are you will win by
wiping out all the enemy factions.

A Must Buy For Every Strategy Fan!
This game does A LOT right and not a lot wrong. I for one don’t have
anything negative to say about this game, my only issue was with the
pre-order bonuses but that is irrelevant now. This game takes a beloved
franchise and makes a fantastic turn-based strategy game out of it.
Whether you are a fan of Warhammer games or a fan of strategy games
(or even just a fan of games in general!) this is a must buy. It offers hours
of content, plus re-playability with the 4 distinct factions.

Faux ! Nul ! Zéro ! Le jeu s’est avéré être une petite perle dans ce monde dominé par les triple A pour assistés : gameplay aux petits oignons, liberté dans un level design de ouf, rejouabilité infinie, bref un de mes jeux préférés de tous les temps. Du coup, c’est en bon fan que j’ai préparé ce test, tout en essayant de rester impartial afin de vous convaincre que ce deuxième épisode est aussi bon. L’histoire en quelques mots : on se retrouve 15 ans après le premier épisode dans l’empire des îles et la pauvre petite impératrice se retrouve dans l’embarras quand sa vilaine tante fait un coup d’état et prend le pouvoir !Ce deuxième opus, passé inaperçu dans l’offre vidéo ludique de la fin d’année 2016, mérite pourtant le détour… Si vous n’aimez pas fouiller, recommencer et perfectionner votre art, que vous préférez qu’on vienne la main, passez votre chemin car à l’instar de jeu comme le dernier Deus Ex, c’est un soft conçu non pas pour rusher mais pour apprécier le travail de maître appliqué à un univers débordant de détails et de possibilités.

La variété des pouvoirs entre les deux protagonistes, les niveaux impressionnants et l’IA (parfois) challenging en font un incontournable du genre que je range aux côtés de Metal Gear et Deus Ex. La trame scénaristiques n’est pas le point fort mais c’est celle que vous écrivez en tant que joueur qui vous apportera la plus grande satisfaction. Il y a tant de façons de parvenir à ses fins que c’est au final le joueur qui écrit l’histoire avec ce sentiment de liberté qui manque cruellement dans la plupart des jeux vidéo.
Le gameplay

Comme dans le précédent opus, il n’y a pas deux façons de terminer une mission. En plus des compétences et pouvoirs à combiner, le level design permet autant d’approches possibles et imaginables en fonction de votre envie. C’est aussi ce qui déterminera vos stats et dans une certaine mesure, votre histoire.

Et si vous ne voulez pas vous salir les mains : invoquez un clone, liez-le aux gardes et lancer votre double dans la mêlée… vous les verrez se mettre en pièce les uns-les autres.

Pour avoir eu le 1, le 2 puis le 3, le travail et améliorations sont bels et bien présents !

Ce SX3 est vraiment au dessus du 2. La physique au sol très bonne et la physique en l'air a bien été travaillée, plus libre et de meilleures sensations qui nous donne de quoi bien s'amuser sans s'écoeuré du jeu au bout d' 1 mois.

Il y a pleins de détails qui ont été peaufinés sur ce SX3:
le son de la moto qui change au passage à proximité des murs (caisse de résonance),
le choix de la ligne d'échappement change légèrement le son de votre moto, 
les sponsors et noms de marques des pièces choisis pour notre monture apparaissent sur le maillot, 
les départs et animations plus immersifs... 
Sans parler des améliorations de la gestuelle du pilote dans sa globalité qui sont vachement plus réalistes. 
Egalement le gros travaille de Milestone pour les menus qui sont enfin dans l'air du temps 

Quelques petites ombres au tableau tout de même (on est chez Milestone):
L'absence totale d'ornières, c'est abusé, 
l'IA moins bonne voir agaçante (trop regroupé, trop agressif et part dans tous les sens), 
la personnalisation au niveau du nom et des chiffres (très peu de choix et toujours la même chose depuis 3 ans), 
certaines bosses pas totalement proches de la réalité (parfois des enchainements très limite (surtout en 250)
Je trouve également que la 250 manque de puissance, n'arrache pas assez lors des accélérations
Certains bugs encore et trop présent et Mileston balance des soit disant correctifs mais cela ne change pas grand chose.
Développeur avare de contenu, on balance des patchs à 4/5/6 dollars pour du dérisoire, alors que cela devrait être gratuit quand on voit le prix du jeu sur certain support ! 

Pour résumé, Milestone a fait encore une fois un gros travail et si certains ne sont pas capable de s'en rendre compte alors il faut qu'ils corrigent leurs vues et regardent un peu les précédents opus. J'ai même pu lire une personne disant que le 1er était meilleur ! Sérieux ?!

Pour conclure, Milestone font un suivi plus sérieux cette année avec déjà quelques MAJ et surtout un mode online enfin plus stable mais il réside encore de nombreux bugs! Si vous recherchez une simu, passez votre chemin, ce jeu est dans la catégorie arcade grand publique.",80

Le jeu est extrêmement technique et connaître un circuit semble être la clé pour réussir avec brio et parfaitement une map afin d'obtenir le rang maximum de celle-ci.

Um jogo altamente galardoado em Independent Game Jams que à primeira vista tem uma aparência evocativa de um Super Mario no que consta ao mapa, mas as semelhanças à propriedade do nosso canalizador favorito terminam aí. Este jogo traz à mesa uma mecânica inédita na qual o jogador tem de manipular as regras do jogo com recursos a blocos, que por norma aparecerão em conjuntos de três, e tal como o título jogo indica: [BABA][IS][YOU]. Algumas das ações que permitem solucionar os níveis são, por exemplo, mudar características físicas do mundo, ou até mesmo mudar a personagem que está a ser controlada durante o nível.

Mesmo nas fases finais, novos blocos e formas de mudar as regras vão aparecendo o que ajuda a evitar que este se torne monótono. Mas o ponto mais negativo que posso apontar é que num jogo que tanto se foca na liberdade e no abuso das regras em prol do jogador, deveria haver mais liberdade no que toca a encontrar soluções para chegar ao fim do nível além da que os devs pretendem.

Graveyard Keeper is described as the most inaccurate medieval cemetery management sim RPG by the devs Lazy Bear Games; it sums up the game pretty well. The game is a management sim RPG with a heavy emphasis on crafting. The setting of the game is that the main character gets hit by a car and somehow ends up in this world where a talking skull introduces you to managing the namesake graveyard. You also need to farm and do a plethora of other activities, like smithing, farming, cooking to make progress. However, you spend much of the game doing things other than tending to the graveyard, like trying to make burgers using meat from the corpses brought from the town by your donkey, who also happens to be a communist. 

The Good
The game has a lot of things going for it. It boasts beautiful pixel art with an incredible level of detail. Especially, the water in the game looks stunning. The NPCs you interact with have animations, like the bishop’s who always pulls out a mirror to check how he looks, which shows their personality. This adds to how detailed the game feels. The game also has a sense of humor, often morbidly so, that manages to stay consistent throughout the game and lends to the charm. It pokes fun at traditional fetch / deliver quest in the first fetch/ deliver quest! 

The gameplay is mostly enjoyable. The crafting system in this game is deep. The various systems in this game intertwine to grant a large number of options that you can pursue to progress further in the game with. Collecting crop wastes to make compost manure also nets you a few maggots, which you can consume for extra energy (yuck!), or use use as a bait to get rare fishes in the fishing minigame. Furthermore, the alchemy system that you unlock later in the game has a lot of depth as well. The game has a hands-on approach, and beyond the first 10 minutes, you will rarely receive any tutorial or hints on how to do things. It’s fantastic for people who like to learn through trial and error and experimentation. Despite the game’s plot being there only as a device for the game’s setting, completing quests for different NPCs and piecing their stories to learn more about the NPCs, and the world by extension, is a rewarding experience. Even though the combat isn’t anything to write home about, there is also a dungeon with 15 increasingly large, difficult levels that you can go through for some rare items that can be used in alchemy and various quests. 

The Bad
That being said, the game also has its fair share of problems. The game still feels incomplete with how some of the tech trees in the late game don’t provide noticeable benefits. Plus, the game has a location in-game that’s teased, that you can get a pass for, but aren’t allowed to go into; it’s not in the game. The devs have cheekily teased it as being available as a DLC soon, but for what’s a full release of the game, this is unacceptable. Next, The incredibly small stamina bar can make it difficult for you to do anything in the early game without going to bed every few minutes. On top of that, with how slow the playable character moves, it can feel like you are spending a lot of your time in-game walking and sleeping. These issues can be fixed with potions and items, but they are not viable early in the game. Also, since the game doesn’t provide any hints, you will be fumbling around, trying to figure things out, which could be fun in and of itself. However, when it comes to elements like the alchemy system, they are not very intuitive, and you will likely be stuck using precious resources trying to craft potions only to get goo. For instance, there is neither a hint anywhere in the game nor is it intuitive that distilling an onion would get me toxic extract, the same onion that I use to make edible, energizing burgers. To help with this, the game does have a fully detailed wiki, but having to pause the game to look at alchemy recipes every time you need a new potion or solution really breaks the immersion. 

In addition to that, there’s another problem with the game which can make it or break it for you. The feeling of satisfaction in these games comes through making a steady progress measured through the completion of quests and goals. Many of the quests in the game can feel hopelessly out of reach; so much so that it can take more than a few hours of grind to complete those. This makes you feel like you’re not making enough progress, which severely impacts the game’s enjoyment factor. What’s more, you can only meet some NPCs in a day of the 6 week cycle. Since there is no option to skip days, you’ll find yourself mindlessly grinding away just so that you can get to that particular day to meet that particular NPC. This, paired with the problems with quest difficulty mentioned above, can make the game feel frustrating with moments where you forget about what you were trying to do and feel like the game is trying to stop you even though it’s supposed to not hold your hands at all. I’ve almost deleted the game a couple of times because of this. 

There are also a couple of other technical issues with the game. The game has frequent stuttering, especially in certain kinds of in-game menus. It’s not enough to break the game, but is noticeable and takes away from the experience. There are also a few bugs in the game. I have even encountered a few that crash the game to the desktop. With how the game saves only after sleeping, this has made me lose some progress made in a single day, which makes the problem worse if you’re already deep into the game. Credit must be given where it’s due, though; the dev team is constantly rolling out patches and has promised content updates.

In a Nutshell
All in all, Graveyard Keeper at its best is a funny game where you run around crafting burgers, growing crops, burying bodies to complete the weird quests that the NPCs have for you. At its worst, Graveyard Keeper can become a slog with frequent alt-tabbing to look at the wiki for help, and grinding for quests that are far out of reach only to get a similar quest once you’ve completed it. My experience with graveyard keeper was a mixed bag with the issues mentioned above being almost unbearable at times. Still, this doesn’t change that graveyard keeper is a charmingly funny cemetery management sim that can offer you hours of fun. The game feels like it should have been an early release seeing that it needs more updates to fix issues and add more content to be what it promises to be, but when that is done, this will be a memorable experience for the fans of this genre. Until then, I can only recommend buying this game if it’s on sale, or if you are are a big fan of these kind of games.

First thing is that you are here to see a review for the MULTIPLAYER and not the SINGLEPLAYER, (Campaign) there are way better games for that. The main reason I got this is because I always loved killing people and getting those radical killstreaks. Not for the campaign, but for the multiplayer. If you are here for the campaign, leave, campaign is about 6 hours long, and there is a lot better games for that, like Far Cry 4, got lots of hours in that for singleplayer only game time. If you are here for multiplayer, then get your wallet ready!

Some FAQ:

Q: Do people still play?
A: Yes, at certain times and places. Where I am i can get a game quick from 10am to 10pm (West Coast, USA)

Q: Is it worth full price? ($60)
A: No, I did not get it for full price, why should you. Buy on sale or through trading. (Key Trading bots/people)

Q: Should I use my controler?
A: No, you will cry cause you get 0 kills.

Q: Can I read?
A: Yes.

Q: Are you just making up questions to make this review longer?
A: Yes.

Q: Why?
A: Why not? Plus I can't think of them, so ask away!

Review for each part of the game:

Campaign-
No, get other games, its fun but to short.

Multiplayer-

Better then most other CoDs. MW2 I own, to many hackers. MW2 being a good CoD.
This game is one of the best and still has a strong community of people that make it hacker less. 
I also own AW, its bad, and now 0 people are play, #2MuchDLC. 
Worth the buy if it was just for this.

Zombies-
Its another fun game, fun by youself and with others!
Different from most zombie games.

Other Pros/Cons

Pros-
-You get 3 games in your Library
-You only have to download the part of the game you want to play, so less space used!
-Not many hackers! Always a good thing

Cons-
-So much paid DLC; a Gun thats super amazinly good, maps that I would like to play, skins. What is this CS:GO? Paying for skins is so CoD, oh wait.
-Less 8 year olds, I like to talk to them, there fun to mess around with
-Sadly no price drop, unlike MW2 and such old games.

So overall well worth the money for the Multiplayer/Zombies!

This DLC is highly anticipated. Based on the game, and furthering the story, the Evil Within Season Pass will give Evil Within players access to 3 new DLC stories, with Kidman and the Keeper's DLC especially of interest.

Who is Juli Kidman? What are her intentions? Why is she trying to kill Leslie Winters? Is she working for Ruvik or against him? These questions and more will hopefully be explained next year when her DLC releases first.

The next question is the Keeper. Allegedly Ruvik's secrets are in the safe that makes up his head, what are they? We learned a lot in the main plot but we need to know the extent of his powers. Did he really escape the machine as a part of Leslie or is he still trapped inside?

Crucially, who IS Ruvik - we know his name, but we don't know why he's done what he has. Why he kills, and what the Keeper's capable of doing.

But it is clear that the developpers didn't spend enough time to make the game stable and without any bugs. 
Major Bug: The most frustrating thing during the game is that when there are several people playing and one of them quits the game, an AI takes his place. Right after that, there is always someone looking to trade with the AI, and this is where the issues begin. The AI accepts to make unfair deals and the player trading with the AI can easily spend like 20-30 minutes to make deals until the AI has nothing, even money. The trade time appears to be unlimited and the AI sells everything at low prices to one player who repeats the trade over and over. Example: the AI has lot of money and cards he got from the real player who left. After half an hour of trades, the AI looses everything to one player.
Minor bug: when dices are thrown, while rolling, they look like they're possesed by a demon or trembling in convulsions instead of rolling normally.
Another minor bug: the game takes a bit too long to load, even on a powerfull computer. As if I was loading Crysis.

The authenticity of the game is taken seriously by the developers. Here, the guns truly feel like they are from an age long ago with lower accuracy and rate of firing, and not just reskinned modern guns. You also have iconic trench battles from World War 1. The maps are also set in pretty iconic locations in the eastern European front of the war. 

This game is not like the many popular run and gun games of today like Call of Duty and such. You will die, a lot. Then, you will get better over time and learn to take the good fights and avoid the bad ones. Tannenberg is a difficult game, but it is all worth it for how rewarding it can be. It is certainly a breath of fresh air when every shooter feels the same; you run around spraying your gun, hoping you to kill as many people until you die, and then respawn and repeat. The game punishes you for dying, and you will have to get better to stop dying. The guns do justice to the time period they were from. The machine guns are slow and mounted. Firing accurately with guns is difficult as there are no scopes. There is a lot of trench combat, and you will be in mud for most of the game. This is not pseudo-realistic like the previous Battlefield game. If you want to see what World War 1 was like, then this is the game for you. 

However, there are still a few issues with the game. The most glaring one being that the graphics are really bad. It looks like the game was made a decade ago when it was made last year., and this was not an aesthetic choice. Hopefully, they can polish up the game a bit, but it is unlikely that they will completely overhaul how the game looks. The other big issue is that the servers aren’t populated often, so the game will be filled with bots. This can be a good thing since you can experience the game even if there are no other players, but at the same time, facing bots in a PvP game only takes away from the experience. On top of these two issues, there are some smaller bugs and issues, but being an early access title those should be ironed out by the time of full release.

An authentic WWI shooter from the creators of Verdun, Tannenberg, set on the eastern front, features a punishing but rewarding combat system that suffers from poor graphics and a small player base. In its current state, I would suggest waiting a bit to see if it improves, or wait until its full release to buy it. Still, if you want to experience an authentic World War 1 shooter and have some money to spare, then you should get this as it is fairly cheap. If you have a small gaming community and maybe can organize play sessions, then it is highly recommended as long as you can looks past the graphics. If you get this game, expect it to be different from other shooters. It’s not done different for the sake of being different; the rewards of surviving such a challenge with your skills and teamwork is immensely satisfying.

As it stands, this game is a 7/10 and can be a 8 if you play with a bunch of friends.

State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition is a post zombie apocalypse, open world survival game. Yes, I know that this genre has titles in abundance, but this game truly differentiates itself from the rest of the crowd. If you are looking for a game that offers an experience like what you would have imagined from a Walking Dead action game, then this is probably the title for you. 

All about the game
Like a Walking Dead game not by Telltale
That would be an apt description for this game. The Telltale games were more about a story told that was set in the same world as the Walking Dead series, but this is a game where you experience being in a similar world. State of Decay is also a sandbox game. Yes, you can do missions, but at the same time you can run off and explore the world, build up your home base with other survivors, and go looting while fighting off horde of zombies that are after you. There is a semi-decent story, but that is not what this game is about at all. You will have a lot more fun by just going around and doing whatever you want. Another thing that makes this game enjoyable is that it is fairly casual compared to other hardcore survival games. So, if you just want to lay back and enjoy this game, you can do that without feeling like you have to be putting in more effort to succeed in the game. The game even also has a simplified inventory system, which can be both a good and a bad thing. For those that are looking for that little bit more immersion or hardcore experience, you may be disappointed by this system, but then again this shouldn’t be the game that you are expect a hardcore experience from.

Hack and Slash
The game has a variety of melee weapons as well as some guns. One thing that ensures that the experience is casual and still fun is that even if you don’t have ammo or a gun, you can always do well with melee weapons. It results in the game feeling very Hack and Slash like. For people that don’t like that kind of experience, they can always stick to the guns. In doing so, it caters to a wide variety of players.

It’s Clunky…
There are a couple of negatives that can be a turn off for some people. The big one is that sometimes the controls feel clunky on keyboard and mouse, but this isn’t an issue when playing with controllers. Also, the inventory can feel a bit too casual. Items have a weight value, which affects your movement. Yet at the same time, every single item takes up the same amount of inventory space, which feels a bit out of place. All in all, I can’t complain too much about these issues; as mentioned before, the game is meant for a casual experience.

Is it worth it?
If you are looking for a Walking Dead like experience, but with a lot of fighting zombies, then this is the game. Although this does not have the IP or any of the actual Walking Dead experience, this is the closest thing to that experience. It is also very casual friendly and caters to a wide variety of players. In addition to that, the base game is available in the Year One Standard Edition, which is similar to a GOTY Edition. You get the base game along with two DLCs for a lower price! The DLCs are great, and will surely add to your experience.

It's mediocre. The graphics are good, but the actual gameplay, if compared to The Sims 3, feels stripped down and like it's missing a few features and items.

Maybe it is that I'm used to The Sims 3 with it's numerous addons, and because The Sims 4 haven't got any yet, it feels empty, but it still feels like standard The Sims 3 has more to offer than The Sims 4. With things like basements missing from the core game, it somewhat limits your creativity. 

If feels like Maxis and EA is going backwards rather than creating something better. I would understand if it was missing some features that was added in The Sims 3 addons, but it would've been nice to see some of the things added in core The Sims 4. But this way they will be able to sell the same addons for The Sims 4 as they sold for the third one. Like University and such.

Pros:
+Graphics are better
+Moods

Cons:
-Feels empty
-Less features compared to standard The Sims 3 (e.g basements)

Tout d'abord les graphisme son génial, les personnage sont refait a l'identique de l'animé, et les attaques sont encore plus époustouflantes que dans les ancien de la série. J'ai commencer a jouer avec naruto en mode kurama et quand j'ai fait ça super, j'ai trouver ça génial. 

Le gameplay est bien sur le plus important dans un jeux de combat et celui de ce jeux est pour moi parfait. Je m'explique, dans les ancien jeux il y avait la possibilité de faire une super attaque et une super super attaque mais on pouvait aussi ce transformer, en Kurama par exemple pour Naruto. Ici nous pouvons toujours faire pareil mais nous devons choisir entre la super super attaque et la transformation avant le match, ce qui équilibre les perso et augmente les façon de jouer. Ils y a aussi un troisième choix que l'on peut faire: celui que je vais appeler le choix amis. Si vous choisisses le choix amis, vos deux compagnon vous aiderons en combat en vous protégeant, attaquant avec vous... Ce choix d'avant combat change complétement la façon dont va ce dérouler le match. Une autre choses très importante pour moi est l'ajout d'un contre qui va enfin empêcher le spam de certain adversaire mais bon je vous laisse découvrir le reste vous même.

Coter histoire, déception a cause de l’enlèvement du mode du même nom. Mais de courte durer grâce a l'ajout de deux mode:
Le premier est un pseudo mode histoire mais au lieu de nous montrer ce que l'on as déjà vus dans l'animer, il ajoute trois récit avec combat interactif qui nous dévoile des choses inconnue de tous et qui sont écrite part le créateur de naruto donc valable dans l'histoire. Vous aller donc découvrir la création de l'akatsuki membre part membre et deux autre récit que vous recouvrirait vous même.

Le second mode est un tournois qui ce passe après la guerre et tout les vivant et les mort ressusciter vont s'affronter dans un méga tournois pour savoir qui est le meilleur ninja! C'est un genre de rpg où vous aller devoir faire des mission pour recruter des personnage ou gagner des objet qui vous aiderons pendant vos combat. Ces combat ne sont pas des combat habituel, les combat sont a quatre et chacun commence avec 1000 orbes de combat. Quand vous taper un joueur il lâcheras des orbes de combat et celui qui en as le plus a la fin, gagne. Simple mais amusant car des choses vont arriver pendant le combat comme des rail où vous pourrai surfer en attaquant vos ennemis, des orbes rouge et bleu apporter par un rat ou un cochon que vous devrez attraper en tapant dedans pour avoir votre transformation ou super super attaque.

Le combat en ligne n'a quand a lui pas changer mais plus de personnalisation sont disponible et vous pourrai envoyer un avatar au combat qui augmenteras de niveau et vous rapporteras des cadeau a la fin d'un certain laps de temps.

Mais le plus intéressent pour moi est le nombre de personnage qu'il est possible de jouer, ils sont tous là a part quelque un qui sont apparue que dans un ou deux épisode du manga.

Pour finir je vais vous dire que, moi, qui n'aime normalement pas chercher toutes les petite chose du jeux pour le finir exactement a 100%, je l'ai fait dans ce jeux car il y a tellement de choix pour les combat que l'ont ne s'en lasse jamais.",100

When starting the game, you have a selection of three difficulties normal, hard and very hard, there is also an iron mutant to choose which introduces perma-death, no manual saving, auto saves after every combat.

More casual or hard-core player base?
The thing this game does different compared to other turned-based strategy games is that you take full control of your team of three mutant stalkers and traveling around a map exploring freely until you find a group of enemies, the player then can go into stealth switch off flash lights and placing your squad in positions that the player thinks is the best for the once in combat the game turns into a turn based game. The game in my experience teaches the player in the first mission the controls and mechanics really well, so it is easy to pick up for those who will be playing a turn-based action game for the first time quite easily
The flow of the game is set at a good pace while free roaming it allows the player to appreciate the environment that is over grown and desalinate from the post-apocalypse around them listening to the spoken dialog for the story, the camera while free roaming is set at a third person view seeing all three characters. This allows players to think strategically on what is the best weapon to use, what tactics player should use and what character skills to use on certain enemy’s during the game.

How It Works
The game has a gear system to take in consideration equipping the characters with what best suits them and for the situation choosing from weapons, armor and headgear. The weapons are pistols, shotguns, assault rifles and sniper rifles there is a total of 15 weapons to choose from and find during the game each with its own damage, critical damage, critical chance ammo, range and if it comes with a silencer or can knockback and destroy cover. The armor you can choose from comes with some armor bonuses, HP bonuses and special effects ranging from immunity to critical hits, increased throwing range and absorbing explosive damage. The head-gear you can choose from comes with special effects such as +25 weapon range, immune to critical hits, +2 grenade damage and more.
You gain experience points after winning fights you encounter to put into the skill tree choosing mutations and abilities each character has eight available mutations and five permanent stat bonuses. Each character can have three active skills at a time, one for a main skill, one for a minor skill and one for a passive skill, for example one main skill can allow the player to use chain lighting during combat to hit a group of enemies in one turn, one minor skill can allow the player to use chameleon becoming invisible until attacking , one passive skill can allow the player to reach high places by moving or sprinting in combat, each playable character has a different skill tree to upgrade and learn.

Is it worth picking up?
I think it is, even for those who are new to this genre of game, it has a lot of charm to it from the story, gameplay, sound design and visual design. Definitely worth picking up for fans of turn-based combat and those who are new to the genre.

Le bonheur de retrouver la NFL sur PC. Je n'avais pas acheté le précédent opus et cette année je me suis laissé tenter.
Graphiquement c'est beau, le gameplay n'a pas énormément évolué par rapport au dernier NFL auquel j'avais joué (NFL2004) je n'ai pas été perdu que ce soit sur les huddles ou de modifier le tracé d'un joueur offensif avant le snap.
En revanche j'ai vraiment été déçu du manque de modèle de jeu. Fini le mode propriétaire où l'on pouvait gérer tout le côté marketing de l'équipe (prix du sandwich dans le stade - pris de la place de parking / la mise à niveau du stade avec l'achat de nouveaux sièges ou enceintes dans le stade etc etc). Aujourd'hui on a le mode franchise qui consiste à faire des saisons toutes simples et le mode Ultimate Team à la Fifa :( 
Egalement déçu par le manque de réaction du public - autrefois lorsque le score était large à l'encontre de l'équipe qui évoluait à domicile, on pouvait voir le stade se vider au fur et à mesure qu'on avançait dans le temps. Ou même si les résultats étaient mauvais au fur et à mesure de la saison, le stade n'était jamais plein.

Haupt- und Nebenmissionen sind zahlreich.
Onlinemodus super integriert und auch abschaltbar, falls einen die Hackangriffe nerven.
Die Grafik ist auf sehr hohen Einstellungen wirklich beeindruckend, auch nach zig Stunden hält man noch gerne an, um Screenshots zu machen und Fotos zu schießen. Vor allem der San Francisco Nebel sieht toll aus. Die Portierung auf PC ist dieses Mal gelungen.
San Francisco und die ganze Bay Area sind sehr schön dargestellt und die Spielwelt wirkt im Vergleich zu WD1 viel lebendiger.
Durch das eigene Handy samt entsprechenden Apps hat man Zugriff auf Missionsinfos, seine Fotos, Nebenmissionen, usw.
Die Fahrphysik ist im Vergleich zu WD1 um Welten besser.
Im 3D-Drucker hat man eine breite Auswahl an Waffen. Ebenso groß ist die Auswahl an Klamotten und Fahrzeugen.
Tastenbelegung deutlich logischer als noch bei WD1.
Man kann nun endlich auch Fahrzeuge, Kräne, usw. hacken und nutzen.

Negativ
Die Hacker sind alle so Mitte 20, reden aber wie Teenager. Auf Dauer ziemlich nervig.
Die Missionen sind teils sehr repetitiv.
Es gibt keinen Chat, d.h. mit anderen Spielern muss man sich umständlich über Uplay unterhalten.
Einige Bugs sind noch vorhanden. Will man bspw aus einem Fahrzeug aussteigen wenn die Fahrertür blockiert ist, rutscht Marcus (der Protagonist) auf den Beifahrersitz rüber und bleibt dann einfach sitzen.
Die Y- und Z-Taste sind bei mir vertauscht, das lässt sich auch nirgends ändern und liegt nicht an meiner Tastatur.
Spielt man mit DSR (Dynamic Super Resolution) treten manchmal am Bildschirmrand unschöne schmale Streifen auf.
Der Klang mancher Fahrzeuge ist echt fürchterlich.

Fazit
Insgesamt ist Watch Dogs 2 - im Vergleich zu dem ersten Teil - in jeglichen Punkten besser geworden. Die Story ist unterhaltsam, die Nebenmissionen zahlreich, die Spielwelt und Grafik wunderschön und auch der Onlinemodus ist gut implementiert. Eine ganz klare Kaufempfehlung.",80

If you just came from work and only want to relax, get it. I guess then it's a ""good"" game for you.

Literally nothing - not a single positive point comes in my mind for Battlefield V.
I am not going to explain why the game is one of the worst games ever developed & if you don't get why, please don't talk.
The actual best state of the game was after the release (Edited this review since then).

If you like this game; following things might be the reason:
- You are a casual & just want to play a game (that's totally okay btw)
- You were promoted/paid by EA/DICE to vote their game up (if so, no words for you)
- You started playing the BF franchise with Battlefield V and you have no idea what a good Battlefield is

Friendly reminder if you care about that point - Battlefield V reveal:
""There won't be any microtransactions! Everything can be unlocked trough just playing the game."" 
Well, take a look now ;)

Just don't .. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, NOR YOUR TIME. Why?
Worse than ever before. Just listing a few negative points:
- Lack of optimization 
- Bugs & glitches
- Complete mess called ""movement""
- Input delay
- Week for week new unplayable playlists
- no RSP with plugins
- In-game / weapon & vehicle balance 
- Countless cheater 
- Skill trees instead of weapon attachments 
- Level & unlock system
- In-game UI
- Random recoil of guns
- Gunplay in general
+ 5 points down below.
... the list could go on.

@DICE SW / EA - Keep doing what you do: Ignore constructive feedback and you ruin your studio(s) even more then you already do now.

Or instead: Shut down this garbage piece of sh*t and don't ever touch Battlefield again, since you love to ruin great games and or genres anyway.

@DICE LA - Fix this game, PLEASE.

Dropped score from 30 to 10. Would even go lower than 0 if possible.

Think twice before buying Battlefield V.",10

Sibéria 2 est encore mieux que le 1er (qui, soyons honnête, a vieilli). Il est la suite logique de celui-ci avec certains flashbacks nous rendant nostalgique du premier. Plus récent, Les personnages sont moins lents. J'ai également trouvé les énigmes plus ""logiques"".

Not only the controls feel much better, the new gadgets like the (Bavarium powered) wingsuit and the retracting tethers alone sell it for me. Out of ammo? Just pull a helicopter into a gas tank and watch it explode. The world design is just amazingly done and beautiful. It is smaller than Panau from Just Cause 2, but also better filled with interesting landmarks and a better variety of things to blow up. Yes the story and characters are as cheesy as they can get. But do you really expect some serious characters with a rich and interesting past to tell you about? This game is just like it's predecessors a playable action movie with a lot of freedom where you can play with your creativity.

But there is a few big downside which are pretty much unnecessary and could've been avoided in making this game. 

downside:+ a few negative points under this text
performance
The performance is sometimes and without tweaking a catastrophe. My PC is high-end and so way over the recommended requirements (i7 7700k, 16GB ram, GTX1070, game installed on SSD) and the FPS sometimes just tank down to ~40 FPS. But that luckily rarely happened in my hours of play time. A simple restart of the game also fixed that for me. 

There is a very helpful guide in the steam guides posted that helps fixing the performance completely. Aside from the framedrops that I mentioned earlier the game ran always at over 60 FPS with all settings on maximum.

Repetetive 
The whole game feels this way, from the stories to the bases to .. everything. They did well giving another look to each base for sure but it does not feel as rewarding as it was in Just Cause 2. 

All in all I would still recommend this game to everyone who likes a good action open world sandbox, even though the setup is annoying. But the fun you will get out of this game is worth taking the 10 minutes to configure it. As long as you don't tab out of the game of course. :p

Battle Brothers is a medieval, turn-based strategy game with management elements. This game is clearly inspired by Mount & Blade, which you can see in the way you go about trading, and travelling around the world map. The key difference from the said game is that Battle Brothers doesn’t have real-time combat, which is instead replaced by the turn-based strategy aspect. This is probably the best way to summarize this game.

Breakdown
Think before you attack
Combat in Battle Brothers has been done incredibly well, and this is coming from someone who is very picky about turn based strategy games! You have a variety of warriors, ranging from your standard archers or swordsman to people with pitchforks. You can arrange your team in various formations which have unique features and provide their own boosts. On top of that, each individual character will level up and develop their own perks. As a result, you will easily get attached to certain characters; especially when the lone survivor from a long drawn battle goes on to level up and fight for you in many successful battles. But you better be careful. Your characters love can be lost forever due to some foolish mistakes. Furthermore, There are many enemies with their own unique mechanics. Some of them even delve into the realm of fantasy. For example, you will encounter zombies who can come back to life and some monsters who will consume the dead to become stronger and you better be weary. 

Finding your golden trade route
One of the things that the game clearly take inspiration from M&B is the way trading is done, as well as the town aspect. Each town has its own kind of economy such as mining, farming, fishing etc. As a result, each town will sell certain goods cheaper and will pay more for certain goods. For example, a farming town will sell you food for cheap, but at the same time, it will pay a hefty sum for a mineral or gem. You will quickly pick up on these things and will look to find your own trade route, which will ensure you get maximum profits in no time!

It looks a bit...unappealing
The aesthetics is the only place I that can give some negative critique to this game. It isn’t the best and will definitely make a few players stay away from the game. However, once you look past the game’s looks and into what the game holds, then you will definitely be pleased with the game.

Are you ready to lose endless hours?
Battle Brothers will do just that. This is the kind of game you will start playing only to look at the clock later to see that you spent the entire day just playing it! That being said, people who don’t enjoy this kind of game will probably not enjoy this one either as it does not reinvent the wheel. However, this is very good in what it does. I wholeheartedly recommend this game. Definitely worth buying!

You can choose that you can be in a team, in this case the game select for you three other players, who you can fight with. But, the team speak is not the best I think.

A tel point qu'il en reprend d'ailleurs bien des éléments, associés à ceux de l'univers ""Endless"" (Endless Space, etc.)

Il s'agit d'un jeu d'exploration, développement, conquête sur des terres inconnues, dans une ambiance Science-Fiction. Le tout sur une carte à cases hexagonales fort colorée, ressemblant d'assez prêt à Civilization Beyond Earth. Le moteur graphique ne fait pas de miracles mais le design des unités est recherché, détaillé. Quant au décor, on note la précision des détails sur les forêts, les montagnes et les ressources.

Niveau gameplay, le jeu reprend donc un mix des mécaniques de Civ et de Endless Space. On retrouve l'implantation et le développement des villes, l'exploration et la gestion des ressources (aménagements sur des cases spécifiques, etc) propres aux jeux du studio Firaxis. Mais on doit également composer avec des éléments spécifiques comme les zones d'influence uniques ou les armées.

Pour faire simple, sachez que la carte est divisée en plusieurs zones géographiques qui reçoivent chacune un nom. Dans chacune de ces zones, une seule ville pourra être construite. Premier arrivé, premier servi donc. Il y aura une logique de rapidité d'expansion si vous souhaitez conquérir la carte dans son ensemble.
Les unités militaires quant à elles doivent être organisées en petites armées qui nécessitent de plus en plus d'entretien à mesure qu'elles grandissent. Elles peuvent être menées par un général. Une fois au combat, l'ensemble des unités se déploie sur la carte et affronte l'armée adverse. Chaque unité est autonome, gérée par l'ordinateur, en fonction des ordres donnés (attaquer, défendre, soigner, etc.). C'est là une des plus grande différence avec Civilization, et cela donne pas mal de profondeur aux combats.

Pour le reste des mécaniques, sachez que le développement va s'axer autour de la Brume, une ressource comparable à l'or ou à l'énergie dans les Civilization. Il faudra la gérer au mieux pour assurer puissance et prospérité à votre royaume.
Le système de diplomatie reprend exactement les mêmes codes qu'Endless Space via un écran spécifique. Attention à l'impacte de vos actions car si les attitudes des adversaires sont plutôt cohérentes, sachez qu'ils sont très rancuniers.
Les factions sont d'ailleurs un des très gros point fort du jeu car elles sont très différentes les unes des autres et vous serez obligés de les jouer très différemment.
De plus, votre partie sera rythmée par une quête principale et des quêtes annexes, vous incitant à choisir entre diverses formes d'expansion.

Comme d'habitude dans ce genre de jeux, la recherche scientifique sera très importante (arbre de technologie très fourni) et permettra de débloquer des avancées militaires ou de développement.
Plusieurs victoires sont possibles : scientifique, militaire, etc.

Un Civ Like très réussi en somme qui fait la jonction entre deux univers. Une très bonne alternative pour ceux qui souhaitent s'éloigner temporairement des jeux Firaxis pour changer un peu d'air.",80

Extinction is a Hack and Slash action game with procedurally generated worlds. You play as a hero tasked with saving humanity from...well, extinction! You have to save small pockets of civilization on each map and fight off against the bosses - giants. .

Breakdown
Attack, attack and attack!
Most of the time you will be fighting off against smaller mobs around a small group of people you are trying to save. Once you defeat the enemies in an area, you have to activate a pillar that will ensure that that group of people are saved from the monsters around. Periodically, huge giants will pop up, and you have to fight them. Basically, they are the bosses of each level. But wait, you can’t just go and hack them to death. Each giant will have pieces of armour around its legs, arms, neck, shoulders, and head. You first have to break these pieces of armour, after which you can proceed to take out said body part of the giant. As you slowly do this, you can expose more parts, and once you have exposed enough, you can strike a finishing blow on the giant.

So which map? Oh wait, it doesn’t really matter
There are a few cities you can choose from to play in, but they all are procedurally generated with minor differences. As a result, what might have been an important decision becomes an irrelevant one. This feels like a missed opportunity as they could have made each city, while being randomly generated, have its own features like different types of enemies or additional environmental elements like lava or earthquakes and such. Yet, as they are randomly generated, it does add a bit of replayability to the game which is a good thing.

Remember to fill your damage boost!
One very unique and nice mechanic is that devs have added to this game, is the boost feature. There is a “damage boost” bar next to the minimap, alongside with the health bar. As you kill more mobs and destroy more chunks of armour from the giants, this bar fills up and increases your damage. The game rewards you for playing, and the rewards encourage you to play more at the same time.

Okay, so what else?
Sadly, there isn’t anything else to do in the game which is a big shame, because it is fun to play. The game would be better with a proper progression system or co-op, but the game doesn’t have those features whatsoever.

Should you pick this up?
It’s a tough question. The game does have a bit to offer, but sometimes it feels repetitive, unless you really like melee combat; only then I would definitely say that it is worth it. You can have quite a bit of fun in this game to make it worth picking up. Also, if they add co-op at any point in the future then it would definitely be worth its price tag. In any other case, it is recommended to wait for a big price drop or a deep sale.

Greedfall (suprisingly fitting name *cough*) did what Bioware and Bethesda failed to deliver the recent years, and delivers a 3rd Person Action RPG with clear focus on its story (which I haven't completed yet though) and good gameplay. 

When creating your character, you can pick 3 from classes (Warrior, Mage and Rogue), each with their own strengths and abilities which can be tweaked as you progress through the game.

The side-quests are very entertaining as well and introduce you to a variety of characters, each with their own background and aims, those are pretty much on Bioware/Piranha Byte-level
The characters are voiced really well (English only though) and the actors made a great job in getting in with their roles, whether they are guards, priests, merchants, or peasants.

Gameplay-wise can do basically everything you'd expect from a 'classic-RPG': talk to all sorts of characters as mentioned, interact with our compatriots (you can shape the relationship to them as well), complete quests and explore dungeons to get that sweet loot, trade, craft, fight (also bosses of course), et cetera.

Now while the game doesn't offer one Open World, we instead travel through several larger environments with some very nice details, although you will often come across replicated assets.
Cities feel like like they have been copy/pasted at times because of this asset-recycling and it really starts to annoy me a little bit by now...
And this is where another negative point kicks in: Graphics.

I wish I had a better way to express it, but at times they really look like the game was made in 2013. Textures aren't that sharp in fact it gets really ugly as you close in, most noticably (I'd say at least,) the floor.

You get random lag spikes and the fps is usually low. If it starts to rain, your fps is screwed.

Except from this, the game is very recycled. Pretty much all of the game's mechanics have been seen before in other games. The most original thing is the gun customization. However, it is really big. Every weapon can be turned into 3 different weapons and different scopes and other attatchments can be applied. The good part about this is that most of the weapons are useful, but there isn't really a lot of options. 

When it comes to the story it is quite dull. You don't really feel attatched to any of the characters and the missions are pretty standard. Fetch that, defend that, sabotage that, etc. Capturing bases isn't really a challenge, and gets very repetitive. The most awful things is the yellow zones where there are civilians. Here you run around cutting wires and turning on radios to get the peoples support, but you get like 2%-3% for each thing you do and it feels like it takes forever.

The only part about the game that is above decent is the map design. The enviornment looks great and the graphics are decent, but the way the map is built when it comes to things like side alleys and alternative routes, it is pretty bad. Especially in the yellow zones.

The co-op is actually really fun, but currently there are only 6 missions and people don't play 2 or 3 of them, so that gets boring pretty fast.

All in all, this game is not worth getting unless you're a real fan of it. It can be fun for a little while, but most likely you will get bored quite fast.",30

Certe cet opus est à prendre comme un ""à côté"", mais de là à avoir si peux de plaisir en bataille, c'est bien rare de mon côté pour un jeu de cette franchise… Autre point important à noter; On ne gère pas ici qu'une, mais cinq ressources afin de pouvoir développer son armée et ça faction. Malheureusement cela rend le titre moins jouissif et nettement plus (voir trop) contraignant. D'ailleurs, l'IA a tendance à proposer des échanges de ressources trop désavantageuse pour le joueur, preuve que ce surplus de ressource est mal géré... Pour en finir avec le gameplay, les guerres éclates anarchiquement de tout les côtés, rendant l'expérience punitive.

Direction artistique: La MAP de campagne est de toute beauté, et que dire des champs de bataille pleinement réussi. Les graphismes sont d'une manière générale affinés pour cet épisode de Total War. 

Scénario: Difficile de parler de scénario à proprement parler dans un Total War, bien qu'ici il faille protéger ou récupérer la belle Hélène de Troy. 

Durée de vie: Moins importante puisque bien moins colossale en contenu qu'un Warhammer 2, qui reste pour moi le meilleur jeu de la franchise actuellement. Pour autant, il y a déjà de quoi faire pour un bon moment à condition de ne pas être trop déçu et lassé (comme je l'ai été) du cruel manque de diversité dans les unités et des factions.",50

Don't buy this game at any given chance, they will backstab you later once all the money is flowing in for 2k.

You found it. Escape From Tarkov isn't just a normal game it's a simulator that tries to bring something similar to a real life shooting mission to the players. It's still in Beta, sure, but it already has so much content. Some people who purchased this game started crying and raging because they where killed instantly at the beginning of the match after 5 minutes or less. ""Invisible people killed me"" those are just other players that probably where far away shooting with a sniper. A lot of people come and are like ""Oh this game looks like call of duty"" this is where they are wrong. You may be a pro in call of duty but in tarkov you are going to get killed easily. 
The game is really interesting, there are many cool stuff like:

-Drinking and Eating: Yeah this is important because after some time your character is gonna get dehydrated or hungry which makes the whole surviving harder. There are cool animations when the player eats or drinks, bringing more realism to the game.

-Armor: This is a really important factor during the gameplay, in fact if you get into a raid with bad armor or without you have a higher chance of getting killed. Helmets help a lot too but it always depends on what gun was used against you and which kind of bullet. So Based on that a face shiled, for example, could save your life or not.

-Bullets: There are so many bullets in this game than in all the others mixed together and there is an important reason. Basic ammo are usually for beginners or for those who don't want to spend much ingame currency on them. The basic ones sure don't do much damage and a well geared enemy may survive many shots before dying but they are effective versus bots some times. If you instead want to easily kill someone tho you may use penetrating bullets which are the ebst choice for players that want to kill easier their enemies.

-Grenades, Flashbangs and smokes:
Nice and cool animation, the flashbang works properly, some times blinding softly, you can see a flash spot but also the surroundings, and other times hardly, you see the flash spot and nothing else around. The smokes are realisticly looking but there is a - the particles of smoke get through textures smoking parts of a building for example a room close to another where there should not be any smoke. About normal grenades, what to say, they are deadly.

These are some of the many good points of the game. Considering this game is still in Beta and it's not the final product it deserves a 100 vote.",100

Killer is Dead est un beat'em all très dynamique mais peu exigeant dans son gameplay. Le nombre de coups spéciaux est relativement faible, et les stratégies à adopter contre chaque ennemi sont peu élaborées. Toutefois, parcourir le jeu pour massacrer du monstre se montre prenant, notamment grâce à l’agressivité des animations. Les boss sont dans l'ensemble mémorables, parfois même magiques ; qu'ils soient complètement fous (Tommy, le train russe qui prend vie) ou plus sérieux (David, le grand méchant du jeu), on prend un malin plaisir à les démembrer et à leur taillader tous les trous tant leur chara-design est réussi. Les difficultés sont bien dosées, et on vous propose pas mal de quêtes alternatives, bien qu'elles soient généralement ennuyantes. Parce que Killer is Dead est japonais, on peut aussi draguer des femmes et même mater leurs sous-vêtements. Sans grand intérêt et pas franchement rigolo, ce mode gigolo n'est là que pour la rigolade (ou si on est un gros cochon). Malheureusement, le jeu souffre d'un énorme problème : son level-design. Catastrophique, vous avancez dans de longs couloirs pas toujours très inspirés dans leur design. On aurait aimé un peu plus d'exploration, plus d'âme. La durée de vie du titre est assez courte : dix heures en ligne droite environs. Heureusement, Killer is Dead dispose d'une bonne rejouabilité.

C'est l'histoire d'un mec qui part sur la Lune, armé d'un katana, pour tuer des humains contrôlés par des monstres et puis...

Visuellement Killer is Dead casse des visages, à n'en pas douter. Que ce soit la direction artistique, proche d'une BD très noire ou encore l'ambiance sombre posée par le scénario. Suda51 oblige, Killer is Dead nous gratifie d'une touche d'humour typiquement nipponne et de scènes complètement déjantées. Surprenant et amusant, le scénario du jeu rame néanmoins sévèrement. Les premières heures excellentes et pleines de mystères laissent présager un bon polar sur fond de fantastique. Puis, au fur et à mesure des chapitres, on s'en éloigne loin, très loin... jusqu'à se perdre complètement. Les personnages secondaires ne sont pas travaillés, les missions s'enchaînent et les clients que l'on sert n'ont aucun impact dans le déroulement de l'histoire. La fin, très ouverte, est sympathique mais laisse un arrière-goût de bâclage et d'inachevé. On ne comprends pas vraiment ce que l'auteur a voulu nous raconter, nous faire ressentir à travers son œuvre. Trop d'éparpillement, pas assez de profondeur, ne serait-ce que dans l'univers dans lequel le joueur évolue. Reste que l'expérience est dépaysante. Quant à la bande-son, elle est également très réussie.

Conclusion

Saisissant dans son ambiance et son style visuel, Killer is Dead se montre également assez marrant à parcourir. Avec sa bande-son aux petits oignons et des décors sacrément chouettes (la maison d'Alice ou la palais sur la Lune), des boss super cool et un gameplay peu complexe mais agressif, on pourrait s'attendre à un jeu presque parfait. Malheureusement, c'est au niveau technique que le jeu pêche : une caméra pas toujours agréable, des missions alternatives et le mode gigolo loin d'être funs, un level-design à l'ouest et un scénario qui ne va pas jusqu'au bout des choses, le titre de Suda51 est à réserver à ses fans, à ceux qui manquent (vraiment) cruellement d'un beat'em all ou qui veulent se plonger dans un délire qui ne laissera personne insensible. 6 sur 10.",60

DIe KI ist grottenschlecht, die Waffen kennt man irgendwie alle schon, die Gegnervielfalt hält sich stark in Grenzen (dauernd die gleichen Fratzen und Frisuren), die Story hätte mehr Potential und es wiederholen sich einige Elemente einfach zu oft.
Wer alle Far Cry über Teil 3 bis Primal gespielt hat läuft Gefahr hier enttäuscht zu werden, denn wirklich übertrumpfen kann der 5. Teil in meinen Augen höchstens Primal und eventuell noch Teil 4, wenn einem das Montana-Setting mehr liegt. 
Auch die Charaktere denen man begegnet konnten mich nicht so richtig begeistern. Den ""Bösewicht"" finde ich garnicht so schlecht wie er von manchen Leuten gemacht wird, aber die Begegnungen mit NPCs auf der Karte sind dann doch eher mau. Da sind mir wenige im Gedächntis geblieben, wirklich interessante Begegnungen waren das größtenteils nicht.

Zum für mich Positiven: Ich hatte trotzdem Spass in den Wäldern mein Unwesen zu treiben, Stützpunkte in die Luft zu jagen und zahllose Peggies mit meiner Smilie-Schaufel ins Jenseits zu prügeln. Die Karte ansich hat mir auch gefallen, ich mag Wälder. Kann aber verstehen, wenn es für manche eventuell etwas monoton anmutet. Die Grafik finde ich, für einen Open-World-Titel, auch in Ordnung. Klar ginge da mehr, aber so läuft das Spiel auch auf Mittelklasserechnern in 1080p solide. Ich würde mir zwar wünschen das man ENDLICH zu einer komplett neuen Engine wechselt, aber von der Atmosphäre her war ich trotzdem zufrieden. 

Die Mikrotransaktionen jucken überhaupt nicht, kein Grund auf diese näher einzugehen. 

Arcade habe ich mir noch nicht genauer angeschaut, Potential wäre vorhanden...hier kommt es aber auf die Community an ob das letztendes vom Erfolg gekrönt sein wird. Kann jetzt noch keiner was zu sagen.

Fazit: Shooterfans können sich das Spiel anschauen, Leute denen Far Cry 4 schon wie ein Aufguß vorkam, werden hier wahrscheinlich auch nicht glücklich. Ausnahmen bestätigen die Regel",80

""So we can't change too many of the core rules, and the core rules are really simple. You're a player, it's in first-person, you have a weapon in your hand and you run around shooting other people."" 

The words above come from Infinity Wards executive producer Mark Rubin and is about the Call of Duty series. He draws a parallel between the incredibly popular game series and football, and says that if one of the sport's suddenly decided to only have seven players on the pitch and that you also get to use your hands, the people would loose interest and stop attending matches.
This conservative philosophy exist for the huge crowd of fans of the series who will recognize it and not get lost in strange novelties. 
And it has left a distinct mark on the new addition to Call of Duty: Ghosts, as in every way, this is exactly what one would expect of a new game in the series.

The campaign begins in an idyllic American place where you sit and talk with your father and brother.
In ordinary Call of Duty-fashion, there are not many minutes before the first explosion color the sky red and the everything falls into chaos. 
Bombs are slamming into the right and left, buildings destroyed before your eyes and you have to survive at any cost.
It starts out pretty good with a premise that arouses interest. 
The South American Federation takes control of the weapon Odin and kills millions of American citizens with bombs. When they have the upper hand they invade the injured shot nation that relies on it feared special dressing Ghosts to turn things around and win the war against all odds.

The campaign is just as exciting and intense as one would expect, with so many explosions that you almost get a nice tan in front of the screen. In a never-ending stream of scenes, we take us through runaway trains, drive a snowmobile across frozen lakes, deep dive among sharks and visit the vacuum of space while we are shooting thousands of opponents to death.
But unfortunately, while the campaign is very full of action, it's completely brain dead. 
Some scenes are so stupid that I just laugh out straight. Clichés succeed each other and to say the least incredible sequence of events is explained with intrigue that could have been written by monkeys at the zoo. 
Or how about a good guy transformed into a vicious sadist who's fed with crops from the South American 

And we have it here with the Call of Duty dog. Infinity Ward assured that we would care about this mutt that comes with along the way, but that is not the case, and the question is rather if they tried to achieve that goal at all. My dog is acting in a fairly useless in a Supporting Role as quickly wasted and then fall in total oblivion. Infinity Ward know their explosions and ""follow the leader with Weapons"" torques, but to tell a believable and interesting story, they really can't.
Fortunately, the multiplayer is still the series' strengths and savior. For the most part, I'm having a lot of fun with the various play modes. My favourite mode is ""hunted"" - a situation where one armed with a pistol at the beginning of the round and then must collect crates to get access to better firepower. Free for all on the game's smallest maps are wonderfully chaotic with the perfect balance between chance and skill.

For me, standing just outside the core group who love the series for what it is, it becomes problematic with few functioning news. Should not a giant company, Activision, with all the money resounding success of Call of Duty draws in, deliver something bigger? Something that makes me lose my breath as nails sticking controller in my hands and pushing me to defy feelings of fatigue and hunger?
There are probably things you don't have time for when a new game is to be replaced every year - then it might just be more of the same. 
Which in the case of Call of Duty: Ghosts works very well because its heart-racing action as the series' hallmark still stands up so well in the competition and delivers an entertaining multiplayer experience.

The question is: How long does it?",70

Not only the controls feel much better, the new gadgets like the (Bavarium powered) wingsuit and the retracting tethers alone sell it for me. Out of ammo? Just pull a helicopter into a gas tank and watch it explode. The world design is just amazingly done and beautiful. It is smaller than Panau from Just Cause 2, but also better filled with interesting landmarks and a better variety of things to blow up. Yes the story and characters are as cheesy as they can get. But do you really expect some serious characters with a rich and interesting past to tell you about? This game is just like it's predecessors a playable action movie with a lot of freedom where you can play with your creativity.

But there is a few big downside which are pretty much unnecessary and could've been avoided in making this game. 

downside:+ a few negative points under this text
performance
The performance is sometimes and without tweaking a catastrophe. My PC is high-end and so way over the recommended requirements (i7 7700k, 16GB ram, GTX1070, game installed on SSD) and the FPS sometimes just tank down to ~40 FPS. But that luckily rarely happened in my hours of play time. A simple restart of the game also fixed that for me. 

There is a very helpful guide in the steam guides posted that helps fixing the performance completely. Aside from the framedrops that I mentioned earlier the game ran always at over 60 FPS with all settings on maximum.

Repetetive 
The whole game feels this way, from the stories to the bases to .. everything. They did well giving another look to each base for sure but it does not feel as rewarding as it was in Just Cause 2. 

All in all I would still recommend this game to everyone who likes a good action open world sandbox, even though the setup is annoying. But the fun you will get out of this game is worth taking the 10 minutes to configure it. As long as you don't tab out of the game of course. :p

This remake was developed by Purple Lamp Studios, and published by THQ Nordic, who you might know from Darksiders, great game. 

The game was released for PC, Xbox One and PS4, but I’ve only played it on PC so I can’t tell you what performance is like on other platforms. Also worth noting this isn’t a comparison review, it’s a review of the remake, and yes there will be a few comparisons, maybe. 
Let’s move on to Story & Gameplay. 

STORY AND GAMEPLAY

So this being a SpongeBob game, you should expect a SpongeBob story, meaning a silly, ridiculous and nonsensical story. And that’s exactly what it is: Plankton wants to take over using robots, but fails terribly when he forgets to set the robots to “Obey” mode, and it’s up to SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy, to save Bikini Bottom.

Like I said, it’s a spongebob game, and story wise, it’s got everything you could possibly expect from a spongebob story. It’s just pure silliness, that’s all. It’s not gonna be for everyone, obviously if you don’t like SpongeBob, well I’d say you’ll quickly get annoyed by the childishness of the game. And I’ll be honest, sometimes SpongeBob’s laugh or the humour of the game got on my nerves a bit, but I felt like it was a bit unfair to complain since that’s literally what SpongeBob is, silly childish humour. 

Other than that there really isn’t much else to say about the story. The game is divided into the three sections of Bikini Bottom, and each section contains several areas for you to explore. In each of these areas you can switch between certain characters to solve certain puzzles, and your goal is essentially to find as many Golden Spatulas so you can open other areas. You usually will be getting these by completing little objectives or collecting objects, but you can also trade currency and collectibles for them too. By the way, there’s a total of 10 areas, and most of them have other characters in them which’ll give you mini objectives to complete for a spatula.

So there’s actually quite a fair amount to do, really. Naturally, it’s not an open world game filled with side quests and whatnot, but it’s got a good amount of content. There’s also a few bosses you get to fight. In terms of how the game actually plays, well, like I said you get to control three characters, Spongebob, sandy and patrick, and they’ve each got different attack sets, and Spongebob can learn different moves throughout the game. That’s pretty much it.

Gameplay wise the game really isn’t complicated, it’s a mix of simple combat and platforming, and it works very well for this particular game. You’ve gotta remember, it was probably aimed at younger audiences, so it’s just important to take the game for what it is.

The game also ran very smoothly, I never had any crashes or fps drops or anything like that.

I do have one or two complaints though, which I think are reasonable, since these concern the technical aspect of the game. I did encounter some bugs such as getting stuck here and there, and my only other complaint, is that the game tends to reset progress for some objectives sometimes. I’m not talking about enemies here, that respawn when you exit an area, but sometimes the game would reset some progress I’d made because I died, and it could be a bit frustrating at times, admittedly. 

Other than that, really nothing bad to say. Typical spongebob story accompanied by simple, fluid gameplay. Pretty chill and easy going on the whole. 

VISUALS

When it comes to visuals & graphics, I must say this game looks pretty good. It’s to be expected, of course, we are in 2020 after all, but the game looks very visually pleasing, and the colour palette is one my eyes certainly enjoyed. The colours didn’t feel over saturated, they didn’t pop out too too much, it was just a very nice look for game. 

It’s also a pretty good improvement from the original game, which is also to be expected. The character models are a lot more detailed, I’ll try and put up some pictures so you guys can see, but each character’s models is really nicely done, and looks a lot more like the show than they did in the original. Animations are very clean too, and the characters you play also have idle animations which I thought was pretty cool. 

So very nice visuals on the whole, didn’t have issues such as texture popping or blurry textures, everything looked really nice, and the colours were really pleasing. 

SOUND & MUSIC

Alright, music! Well, like a lot of other aspects of this game, the game’s music is really what you would expect from it. Obligatory, the Spongebob theme song is in the game, but other than that you have your typical Spongebob music, with the hawaiian ish guitar usually leading. This is usually the case for the game’s hub, Bikini Bottom, but each area has got its little soundtrack too. 

As for sound, it’s very cartoon ish, as you might expect. For example, a spring noise for jumping, the boing noise, the slap noise for attacking, things like that. 

Regarding sound and music, I don’t have much else to say. The game’s sound design is on the whole pretty good, nothing spectacular of course, but definitely nice to listen to. 

FINAL THOUGHTS & OPINION

Well, this was a relatively short review I’d say, and I know I’ve said this a few times already, but this game is exactly what you would expect from a Spongebob game. I saw a lot of people hating on the game for being dumb and whatever, but like, that’s exactly what Spongebob is. 

So just keep this in mind when buying the game, it is mostly aimed at people who like Spongebob, and well, naturally, it’s gonna have Spongebob things, such as silly humour, dum dum characters and a ridiculously absurd story. 

However, I don’t wanna gatekeep this game, and I do think that if you’re into platforming games and just want a relaxing, chill time, then this game might be for you. It can actually get somewhat challenging at times, if you’ve watched my let’s play you’ll know I actually died a few times, and I can’t tell if that’s embarrassing or not. 

Again, keep in mind this is a spongebob game, and it’s exactly what you would expect from a spongebob game, pure silliness and simple fun. If you can’t accept that, you’ll get annoyed very easily. 
Overall, very fun and chill game, and a great improvement over the original game, mostly on the visual side of things. 

That’s gonna be it for my review, I hope it wasn’t too short, but really there’s only so much I can talk about concerning this game, and I feel like I’ve said what I needed to. Again, remember it’s a spongebob game, not some full blown action rpg with amazing mechanics.",90

It is a must buy for every DBZ fan (and not only) who can afford it. 

Storyline 10/10

I really like the idea of the storyline. Basically, you make your own character (you can choose between Saiyan, Human, Majin, Namekian and Freeza's race) and you travel in time with Trunks because some of the events are changing (for example Vegeta kills everyone when he first arrives on Earth) so you have to help. Those changes are caused by 2 persons which appear only in the game. You can also do parralel quests either alone or with other players and you can even speak with them. This game is playable both online and offline ( you can play it with a friend if you have 2 controllers).

Graphics 8/10

It kind of resemble the original series so it's not the best one. I like the fact that you have better combat system and far more abilities.

Themes / music 8/10

I don't really like the in-game themes but the intro is really awesome (at least for me).

Overall 9/10

A good thing is that you can select the voice language (English or Japanese). Some characters can be unlocked only when you meet certain requirements. Most of the abilities (if not all) can be bought from the in-game store a certain amount of in-game currency (Zeni, so you don't need real money), for example Super Saiyan (ultimate ability) can be bought when you reach a certain level (16 I think) for 50000 Zeni. It can only be purchased by the ones who made a character from the Saiyan race. It also respects the original one so it drains your Ki pretty quickly. Overall, the game is really nice and you have a lot of things to do in it.

This game was crowd funded and was very hyped leading up to its launch. So did it live up to it?

So, have you taken your Joy today?
The premise of the game is that Britain gave all of its children to Germany at the end of The World War.
You play as 3 different characters with different playstyles and story arcs. In this world everyone have to take an anti-depressant called Joy. 
The game has a beautifully designed dystopian open world that is very Orwellian. There are NPC’s called “Bobbies”(constables) that are there as enforcers. If they think someone isn’t taking their Joy then they go and correct that. Even in a small group they can be difficult to deal with. Even in everyone’s house’s there is this contraption known as a “Down Detector” that can detect if you are not taking your Joy and call the Bobbies on you.

Hey! You there, why are you running?!
In most games the NPCs will turn a blind eye to the fact that you are carrying a weapon and behaving oddly, but not in We Happy Few. Here, if you are running without reason in the city then the Bobbies will be after you. If you are walking around with a weapon then you better make sure no one spots you, unless you want to face the Bobbies again. 

Open up! I want my Blackberry Joy!

You play as 3 characters, Arthur, Sally and Ollie. Once you finish one character’s arc and are about to move onto the next you will be notified, as you will not be able to go back and play as the previous character. 
Each one of them has a different story and playstyle. 
For example, Sally(my favorite of the 3), is a chemist who has to stick to a schedule because the constables want her “Blackberry Joy” on a regular basis at a specific time, so you better make sure that you are ready with it on the dot. 
This is something you have to do in between everything else. 
The game also has a skill system and the skills offered are very apt to your situation, for example one of the perks lets you run without arousing suspicion. This is extremely useful as playing without this throughout the entire game may feel tedious as the mechanism of acting a character may get boring towards the end of the game, but this will let you be a bit more free. 
The game looks beautiful as well throughout the most parts with only some instances of texture issues.

What will the Down Detector say about this game?
What about the negatives? Well, right now there are few negatives. There are few bugs, but nothing major that would ruin your experience with the game.

Will I need to take some Joy to playthrough the game?
To sum it up, this game is one with lots of potential and ambition but sadly bugs ruin the perfect picture. If you love the idea of the game then you probably won’t regret getting.

Il n'y a pas de gênes ""meilleurs"" que d'autres, il faudra choisir en fonction de votre environnement et de manière réfléchis. Chaque détail comptera et la consanguinité sera très punitive. Il faudra alors user de ruse, et de chance (surtout de chance), pour passer d'îles en îles et de jour en jour, en conservant vos créatures. 
Ce n'est pas le jeu mignon gnan-gnan où vous élèverez des créatures plus choux les unes que les autres ; on parle là, bien de survie par l'espèce, de difficulté et de décisions parfois punitives.

On peut malheureusement se plaindre d'une sorte de redondance après 20h heures de jeu, et des décès causés trop rapidement. Aussi, la dureté de conserver de bons gènes sans consanguinités, force parfois à l'extinction, surtout sans une dose de chance, ce qui peut augmenter la sensation de frustration. Des onglets ou possibilités inutiles ou non-expliqués et des graphismes plutôt moyens. 

En conclusion : Niche - a genetics survival game n'est pas à mettre entre toutes les mains, Vous devrez faire procréer vos créatures dans le soucis de la survie par l'espèce dans son environnement. C'est un jeu punitif et compliqué, qui, passé les graphismes un peu laid, vous fera hurler de douleurs lorsque votre espèce s'éteindra, et/ou vous fera ressentir un sentiment de puissance lorsque celle-ci prospérera.

Aquí os dejo mis PROS y CONTRAS (y obviamente el porqué del negativo)

PROS:

- Personajes carismáticos.
- Ambientación Mutant Punk.
- Sistema mixto tiempo real y combate por turnos.
- Básicamente si te gustó el juego base, sigue teniendo todos sus puntos fuertes.

CONTRAS:

- Precio MUY alto para las horas de juego (en 6hrs siendo generoso te lo comes)
- Historia floja, que para más guasa te da a entender que habrán más DLC´s
- Sigue sin mejorar fallos en el combate (cámara, IA,etc.)
- 1 personaje nuevo (bastante pocho) para seguir llevando un equipo de 3 integrantes.

Han tenido uno 6 meses para mejorar un buen trabajo que fue el Mutan Year Zero: Road To Eden y ha acabado dándome la sensación de un saca dinero y a correr de ahí, mi VOTO negativo.

The Character level system is intuitive and fun since you have to earn souls by killing enemies and then sell them to Vulgrim to upgrade your level giving you a skill point you can spend freely on the 3 Attributes health, Strength and Magic, all enhancing the character in the long run.
The story is great and builds on the story of Darksiders 1 and 2.

Ständig die Vergleiche mit Diablo und PoE, es sind Hack n Slays mehr haben die Spiele aber auch !!nicht wirklich!! gemein.

Ich habe jetzt 15 Sunden mit dem Spiel verbracht, bin noch nicht durch die ganze Handlung durch und hatte verdammt viel Spaß daran mich mit meinem Wikinger durch die wirklich schön gestalteten Level zu schlachten. (Ich kam ehrlich gesagt fast nicht mehr davon weg ;))
!Update:01.04.2017 (Kein Aprilscherz, leider)
Nun bin ich mit ca 25 Stunden durch und habe noch einiges festgestellt und werde meine Wertung leider auch etwas absenken müssen. Eine 74.

!Update 05.04.2017: Die Entwickler hauen einen Patch nach dem anderen Raus, viele Fehler wurden inzwischen behoben. Das Spiel wird also gepflegt und eventuell erweitert.
Wertung wieder etwas angehoben. :)

Grafik/Gestaltung/Technik:
Die Atmosphäre die das Spiel nur durch die visuellen Anteile aufbaut ist schön stimmig, und wird durch das Wiedrigkeitssystem noch etwas mit Nervenkitzel aufgebaut. Die Gebiete sind schön abwechslungsreich gestaltet. (Schnee-,Sumpf-""Höllen""- und Lava-gebiete)
Technisch ist es zwar nicht auf dem neuesten High-End-Stand sieht aber an den meisten stellen sehr schön aus (gerade die Schneegebiete). Animationen und ""Gore-Effekte"" sind flüssig und sehen gerade in Slowmotion echt schick aus.
Update:1.04.2017
Hier bleib ich dabei, es kommen noch ein Paar andere Gebiets und Gegnertypen dazu, die auch echt schön gestaltet sind.

Story/Erzählung:
Nun, das ist ein Punkt der mir als Liebhaber von guten Geschichten in Spielen am ehesten als Negativpunkt in den Sinn kommt. Gut Synchronisiert ist diese auf jeden Fall! Doch sie ist unglaublich platt und nur in kurzen Bildschirmtexten aufgeschrieben und Synchronisiert, es ist aber keine Katastrophe, nur keine komplexe Geschichte alla Dragon Age oder ähnlichem.
Irgendwie hat es aber echt Charme, es nimmt sich auch nicht wirklich ernst, was man an kleinen One-Liner Sprüchen des Charakters und kleinen Hommagen wie z.B. zu Herr der Ringe immer wieder zu merken bekommt, ich musste teils wirklich Lachen und das im positiven Sinne.
Update:01.04.2017
Von ca Mitte der Story bis ende überkam mich aber langsam dieses ""Wann ist endlich rum- Gefühl"", denn es wird dann doch etwas arg langatmig und öde immer noch irgendetwas ""Zu besorgen"". Das Ende war dann nicht wirklich das was man als befriedigend bezeichnen kann, aber endlich hat man es geschafft(^^').

Gameplay(und Skill-/Craftingsystem):
Das ist die große Stärke des Spieles, es ist simpel, aber es macht verdammt viel Spaß, gerade weil es so einfach gehalten ist.Gerade mit Controller spielt es einfach super. 
Spielerisch einfach große klasse, da Ufer ich einfach mal nicht aus.
Update:1.04.2017
Ok. Es macht Spaß, das auf jeden Fall mir sind nun aber doch echt krasse No-Go Punkte aufgefallen, Bugs die mich die Raubzüge nicht zuende machen Lassen, Gegner die nicht angegriffen werden und stellen an den ich hängen bleibe. Phu....und einem wird beim New-Game+ alles genommen, außer die Skills und Lvl (da hab ich sogar 2 geschenkt bekommen bis Stufe 30...machts auch nicht besser^^). Wirklich Motivation nochmal zu spielen hab ich nicht, leider da es eigentlich echt Spaß gemacht hat.

Zum Crafting: 
Man Baut sich sein Dorf aus dem Ruin wieder auf, Sammelt dabei Rohstoffe und Bastelt sich bei Rüstungs- und Schwert-schmied seine Ausrüstung zusammen, droppen tut natürlich während der sog. Raubzüge auch etwas ,moderat aber wenn dann ist es auch brauchbar. 

Nun noch der Skilltree:
JA! er ist kein komplexes 10 Quadratkilometer großes Mindmap, aber wer bracht das schon, wenn er sich einfach durch Horden von Gegnern kloppen will? Und dafür ist er trotzdem sehr Umfangreich, linear, aber Umfangreich und motivierend! (für mich in diesem Fall ein Plus!) Es gibt andere Spiele, da kann ich minen Character ausbauen und mich durch Tabellen und Guides schlagen, das kostet aber Zeit, in der man neunmal nicht wirklich spielt.
Update:1.04.2017
Wie bisher, aber etwas Spielerei am Ende wäre evtl doch etwas das dem Spiel etwas ""Pepp"" gegeben hätte. 

Fazit: Man hat Abends nach dem Arbeiten den Kopf voll, möchte einfach etwas spielen was nicht anstrengend ist (bis auf die Bosse, die haben Dark-Souls potential :), dann haut man sich so etwas wie dieses Spiel rein, hat Spaß, etwas Humor und schöne Atmosphäre. 
Gebt ihm einfach eine Chance und lasst euch drauf ein.
Update:1.04.2017
Aber nicht als ""Endlos""-Spiel geeignet, da es da nach dem Durchspielen doch wenig Motivation bietet.

Negativ ist mir aufgefallen, dass im Spiel sehr aktiv Werbung für den kostenpflichtigen Abo-Service Just Dance Unlimited gemacht wird.

Das Spiel hätte richtig gut werden können, leider war dies bei mir nicht der Fall. Die Steuerung ist Geschmackssache. Mir persönlich gefällt sie nicht. Die Maus Empfindlichkeit ist für mich auch zu Hoch.

The game set a funny tone, all the characters are stereotype and have funny dialog. I really enjoy the fact that you evolve through time (if you have the DLC modern times). There is a lot of things to explain about the game so I make it quick : it's really a complete (if you have all the dlc) and funny game, the only thing that misses is building tunnels and bridges (that feature is available in Tropico 6).

NWN è un rpg legato alle regole di D&D 3.5 unite al mondo di Forgotten Realms, la storia si divide in diversi capitoli che, anche se non mostrano una difficoltà esageratamente elevata, raccontano una storia degna di nota.

Personaggio non troppo difficile da creare, tristemente non troppo customizzabile, ad ogni modo riuscirete a trovare uno stile di gioco che vi aggraderà. Meccaniche elementari, tuttavia non da prendere sottogamba, i nemici possono diventare molto forti.

L'univers est très bien retranscrit, les graphismes sont plutôt bien réalisés, et les combats sont vraiment dynamiques.

Il manque quelques petites choses pour vraiment apprécier ce jeu, je trouve ( pour ma part ) qu'il manque des choses quant à la spécialisation de notre avatar ( je parle pour les jutsus ).

En effet, a la Ultimate Ninja Storm, le personnage dispose de 2 jutsus ""de base"" et d'un jutsu dit ""secret"". Sachant qu'il y'a 4 types de jeu qui sont Attaque, Distance, Défense et Soigneur. Je trouve que cela fait un peu léger, et le fait de ne jouer qu'avec ces 3 techniques rends les combats assez répétitifs, et réduit les chances de vous démarquer des autres joueurs. Encore une fois ce n'est que mon point de vue.

Le jeu est très principalement PVP. C'est la source principale d'xp, si je ne dis pas de bêtises ! Les combats se font a 4 contre 4, avec différents enjeux comme capture de base ou encore match a mort, a la call of ! A vous de créer vos synergies avec les différents membres de votre équipe.

Un système de maître assez complet, qui vous permet de choisir un mentors parmi les personnages les plus emblématiques de l'animé, qui vous apprendront leur techniques au fur et a mesure que vous gagnerez de l’expérience dans la formation qu'ils vous enseigneront. 

Notez que vous avez accès a un mode solo, qui n'est autre qu'un enchaînement de missions a faire avec votre maître, ou alors en coop,avec d'autres apprentis ninja :) C'est ce mode qui permet de déverrouiller les différents mentors au fur et a mesure que vous accomplirez es missions qui vous sont confiées.

The GRAPHICS are top notch, making some landscapes very realistic. Making it seem more like a photo than a video game.
Optimised for high and low performance computers. I was able to play it comfortably on a low budget laptop.

The GAMEPLAY is easy enough to get the hang on and yet full and more complex than a normal racing game. Good enough to make you want to get back in the game even after months of absence.

The STORY is a fair one. Not too complicated, therefore easy to follow. But as an essential part of a game, the main story left me unsatisfied, waiting for more. Which it shouldn't. Therefore i give it a lower rating than the other 2.

If you like racing games, this one is for you. There is no doubt. But as that - A racing game. You shouldn't expect a mind-blowing story because it focuses more on the experience of the gameplay.",80

outre cette fainéantise accablante de square enix et sa soif d'argent, on a quand même le droit a 2 bon final fantasy:

Final fantasy III nous fait suivre les aventures de 4 guerriers de la lumière : Luneth, Arc, Refia et Ingus qui s’en vont restaurer la balance entre la lumière et les ténèbres. Les combats se font au tour par tour, pas d'ATB bien sur. On a droit a 23 jobs différent (pour chaque personnages) incluant le chevalier oignon qui ne peut être obtenue que par une quête annexe. quêtes annexes qui peuvent toutefois buguer (vous ne recevrez pas les lettres les activant) et ainsi vous empêcher de terminer complètement le jeu et de vaincre tout ses défis lors du premier playthrough. Si ce n'est cela, ça reste un bon FF auquel j'ai pris plaisir a jouer et qui a une excellente durée de vie si vous souhaitez le compléter totalement, c'est le paradis du farmeur, ce qui est le cas de tout le FF quand on y pense.

Final Fantasy IV quant à lui nous fait suivre les aventures de cécil chevalier noir sous les ordres de Baron et toute sa clique. on a droit a un doublage horrible en Va mais heureusement nos amis les modeurs nous ont donné la possibilité de jouer en Vo. Ici l'histoire est bien plus prenante que dans le III, amour, trahison, mort... on fini par s’attacher a Cécil et à ses compagnons. les combats sont un peu plus agaçant toutefois, avec le chargement de la jauge d'attaque avant de pouvoir attaquer (oui je hais l'ATB). Ajoutons a cela qu'il n'y a pas de jobs, ce qui est un gros point noir pour moi. Au final ça reste un bon FF qui saura plaire à beaucoup de gens. 

Je met 90 a ce double pack ; les 2 jeux sont bon mais ont leurs défauts. ce qui me déplaît le plus c'est surtout les méthodes de SE qui recycle ses classiques datant d'une vingtaine d'année, avec le minimum syndical tout en nous faisant payer le prix fort. ",90

Chaque partie lançait en multi aussi bien arène que circuit vous vous retrouvez avec 10 joueurs voire 8 joueurs IA presque aucun joueur. on a fait vite le tour des circuits qui sont beaucoup moins attractifs et délirant que les anciens opus de micromachine. une fois niveaux 10 il me faut attendre 92 jours pour faire de la classer peut-être un bug je ne sais pas?

The GRAPHICS are top notch, making some landscapes very realistic. Making it seem more like a photo than a video game.
Optimised for high and low performance computers. I was able to play it comfortably on a low budget laptop.

The GAMEPLAY is easy enough to get the hang on and yet full and more complex than a normal racing game. Good enough to make you want to get back in the game even after months of absence.

The STORY is a fair one. Not too complicated, therefore easy to follow. But as an essential part of a game, the main story left me unsatisfied, waiting for more. Which it shouldn't. Therefore i give it a lower rating than the other 2.

Conclusion:
If you like racing games, this one is for you. There is no doubt. But as that - A racing game. You shouldn't expect a mind-blowing story because it focuses more on the experience of the gameplay.",80

Police cars are overpowered but that is to be expected. What is not expected are the demanded millions of points in order to progress further in game.

It is the fourth game in the Just Cause series and the successor to its 2015 game Just Cause 3. A somewhat similar game to this one is Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Breakpoint. They are the same genre, both are TPS shooter and you will find some similarities in the gameplay.
Just Cause 4 is set in a fictional South American country named Solis, which is home to some extreme weather conditions. The game has been launched at the end of 2018.

Special features
In this game you have a wingsuit which gives you some cool gameplay experience. You can go skydiving, base jumping and free dive with no limits. You will fight your enemies under some extreme weather conditions, including treacherous tornadoes and lighting storms. Also, a special thing in this game is that you can use the extreme weather events to your advantage thanks to the never seen before in-game physics.
The plot takes place after the events of Just Cause 3 when Rico Rodriguez is approached by a Solis native, Mira Morales. She convinces him to come to Solis to uncover the truth about Project Illapa. The projects scope is to create weather cores able to control the weather and create storms. Also, Miguel Rodriguez (Rico’s father) had a part in creating those. The project is run by the incumbent Solis leader Oscar Espinosa. He maintains strict control over the people of Solis. What you need to do is to dive into the South American nation of Solis, the homeland of the Black Hand and search of answers.

Graphics and art design
Even though the game still has some bugs the graphics will make up for it. The art design plus the graphics for this game make a good combination making it look somehow realistic with all the shadows and reflections. Speaking of the art design itself, it is very good giving the game a very tropical feeling.

Better that the Older Games?
This game still needs some improvements. The bugs must be fixed for sure, but after all this is still a good game. I can’t say for sure if this is better than some of the older ones in this series, but if you liked previous JC games, you will like this one for its story and gameplay. In conclusion, I can recommend this game for all TPS and JC lovers.

Now, you must be turning your heads away as this genre is quite over-
saturated of late, but fear not, as this game has one extremely crucial
and unique distinction. That is in the story. The premise of the game is
that a war has just gotten over and the “evil” side has won. Now you
work for this faction and are basically cleaning up the aftermath of the
war. And the big difference is that this game gives you total freedom of
your decisions. You can choose to be sympathetic and show mercy to
the people or you can show your dark side and be, as the name of the
game might hint, a tyrant!

*Be Your Own Villain*
This game offers you a very thorough character creation option. You can
choose to be an archer or a swordsman, a rogue or a tank and so on. You
can be whatever you want and customise everything to the tee. This one
feature in itself offers this game a ton of re-playability! Once you
finished the game as a frontline tank, why not try experiencing it as a
wizard? The possibilities are endless!

*Truly Freedom Of Choice*
As I have said in my opening paragraph, this game shows you the other
side of the coin when it comes to the classic tale of Good vs Evil. You are
on the side of Evil and you have to ensure the homeless people who
have had their lived ripped apart in the aftermath of the war are dealt
with. You can choose to throw them all to jail without reason or you can
be a merciful character in a world without heart. The choice is yours.
This is where the RPG element of the game stems from. You can choose to invest in skill points that will aid you on your journey or you can choose ones that might hinder your decisions but help you in combat. This is a vast and diverse system that is easy to understand but has layers of depth for more experienced players. The path is yours to forge!

*Snail’s Pace Combat…Yawn*
This game has a lot of positives but there is one negative aspect to it that
I feel has to be stated in a review, and that is the combat. This is real
time combat with the option to pause so you can micromanage your
party members and use their abilities. There is the option to have the AI
control your party members, so you can keep the combat real time, but
,as you learn more abilities it becomes harder to play using this, as the
computer may not target who you want to target or may heal the wrong
member. So the game immediately forces some amount of
micromanagement on players and on top of that the combat is …. just
dull and extremely slow. I don’t know how else to describe it. Some
players may enjoy it, but I can’t say that I did. Even players who enjoy
slower strategy games might not enjoy this game’s combat.

*Get Started On Your Path To Tyranny*
Now I have talked about the one big negative and that is the combat but
don’t let this deter you as the rest of the game is quite enjoyable. It has
re-playability through just the character creation, not to mention the
choices you will have to make. It also has a unique and interesting story
to keep you hooked. I can safely say that a lot of people will enjoy this
game despite the combat gameplay being kind of a let down.

Originally it was a joke, I was a fan of Naruto and Ultimate Ninja as a kid but as an adult my interest in the show was pretty much nil and the games pretty much met the same fate after a disaster of a romp through the demo back when UNS first came out (to say nothing of what I think of the latter now). So I booted up the game, watched the opening cutscene, and immediately remembered what it was that I loved about CyberConnect 2.

Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 is an Arena-style Fighting game that, for the most part, is pretty simplistic. The main draw of this game, as odd as it might sound for a Fighting game, is its story. Now, probably the biggest problem with Bandai porting UNS 3 specifically is that UNS3, despite originally starting before the events of the series, the game is mostly still a sequel to UNS2, and while the events are referenced and mentioned, it doesn't actually give any real form of a recap. This in mind, the Ninja Timeline lets you replay fights that took place in the past with descriptions, so if you do find yourself wanting to brush up on the story a bit, the option's there.

One thing that's worth noting about the game's Story Mode is that it represents what, to me, is the biggest selling point for the Ultimate Ninja Storm series: the presentation. I mentioned above that, before I played this game, I was basically pretty Naruto neutral. The anime's quality varied too often and had too many episodes for me to want to get back into and I just couldn't motivate myself to read the manga. I'd say my stance on the series had basically become that of the masses and it was just kind of...there. Along comes Ninja Storm 3 to practically sweep me off my feet thanks to CyberConnect 2's amazing cinematic direction. There aren't too many games I can think of that can present their anime titles in such a way that they really feel like their own, that they don't simply feel like a cash-in of a product that was more popular as an anime/manga/LN/VN/take your pick.

The Story Mode has a bit of exploration in between its cutscenes and fights, but for the most part, it's told in the latter two formats- after beating the story you can explore as you wish, so there's no real loss here. Though, when compared to something like Ubisoft's Rise of a Ninja series, the exploration here definitely feels rather lackluster. This is something of an unfair comparison, though, as that series was partially advertised for its exploration, but even when compared to the original Ultimate Ninja games (2 and 3 in particular), the exploration feels superficial during the campaign and unintuitive after all's said and done. However, it rarely lasts for a long enough time that it's particularly boring.

When a fight does take place, you will be taken to a menu that will allow you to ready your ninja tools. For the most part this is pretty arbitrary and it's unlikely that you'll actually use them, but it's an option. From here the fight will begin, assuming you aren't given an Ultimate Decision. Ultimate Decisions are points in the game where you need to make a choice and that choice will affect the fight. In a very brass tacks sense, this is just choosing the difficulty of a fight and if you know how hard you want it to be, you'll know which one you want to pick, usually. But this difficulty switch generally feels pretty tangible, and while the choice has no real affect on the story, it does affect the gameplay. 

For example, at the beginning of the game you're presented with a choice between saving going to protect the currently-under-fire Leaf Village or investigating the strange masked man that was at the scene. Should you choose the former, which is a Hero's Path option, you'll skip the first fight with the Masked Man and go straight to controlling the Third Hokage. In the Legend Path, though, you do both.This decision isn't always as simple as just skipping parts of fights, however. In later parts of the game, the decision can change the nature of a fight altogether or change it in smaller, more interesting ways. It's a system that could've been a lot more superficial than it turned out to be but actually adds a bit of replay value to the story.

As for the fights themselves, these are, as stated above, pretty simple. Combos are generally as simple as either attacking with the one attack button or attacking with the one attack button and also inputting a direction, and you also have a ranged attack and a justsu at your disposal, as well as a Secret Technique. If you're expecting a complex fighting experience here, there's not really much to see. Along with the combos being particularly simple, the jutsu (which basically just means technique), is merely a two button process, that's really all there is to the game. And while this might not sound particularly exciting, the various parts of the gameplay blend together rather nicely.

For the most part, it's a game about maneuverability. The various arenas in the game can be pretty large, but since you're ninjas you'll be jumping and dashing all over the place, and for the most part this feels pretty good. Being able to close the distance between someone and create a similar distance between the two of you all while trying to predict who will strike when so as not to use up your substitutions is harrowing. What are substitutions? Basically the most important mechanic in the game. Essentially, substitutions are a regenerating resource that lets you avoid damage by replacing yourself with an object (a log, usually). Relying on substitutions too much, however, will generally leave you with a depleted resource and no way to defend yourself from your enemy's onslaught. This isn't to say that substitutions make it impossible to maneuver effectively, as it's generally that type of thinking that leads to prophecies being self-fulfilled, but they certainly do play a major part in one's overall mobility.

Also QTEs. In Story Mode, after certain events, the game will go into QTE mode and you'll have to enter actions in time as they appear. Now, most people would generally groan at this, but those who have played the game will probably agree that QTEs rarely see better usage than how they work here. Once the cutscenes start, it's all gratification the whole way through, and you know you're going to be in for some eye candy if you do everything right.

For the unconvinced, here's a prime example of all of the above put to work.

Now, the problem with this fighting system, and the reason I recommend this game for its Story more than anything else, is that the simplicity of the combat can make it a bit tedious. Sure, online play (which works well but can be a bit wonky, especially when playing internationally) and local multiplayer is there to entertain you and there are a few small modes outside of the story to keep things fresh, as well as a bunch of unlockables, but all-in-all this is likely the type of game that (after completion) you'll be playing a lot in short bursts rather than for long periods of time. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but it definitely does leave more to be desired. I can't help but feel that more in the way of customization or just a little more depth to the battle system could really make the game a far more engaging experience, but after completing the game there really isn't all that much to do and it's basically best to just jump into Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 (because you really don't need to play Revolution. Really.)

Naruto fan or otherwise, this game is a great showcase of CC2's brand of cinematic excellence and writing and is a great alternative to the anime/manga proper.

Resident Evil 2 es un juego que nadie se deberia perder, si bien se de antemano que no es para todo el mundo, es un juego estresante, agobiante y sobre todo dificil; es para aquellas personas que valoran un reto sobre otras cosas, por supuesto, un survival horror con todas las letras. Y espero que Capcom entienda de una vez por todas que este es el camino a seguir, no solo haciendo remakes, sino nuevos juegos de la saga Resident Evil o de otras sagas muertas, o incluso nuevas, pero de esta manera, sin abusos contra los jugadores, y con una dosis impresionante de creatividad.

Tan solo me queda decir ¡Bienvenido de nuevo Resident Evil! Y espero que esto genere una nueva ola en juegos Survival Horror de este estilo, que ya lo veníamos necesitando desde hace mucho tiempo.

You are tasked with having to manage and take care of all the crimes that go on in the town. Nice concept, right? But does it live up to it?

Good Cop, Bad Cop
The cops in this game, have a mind of their own. If you are not nice to them then way you need them to pull through for you and maybe work overtime they won’t. And this is where the management aspect of the game comes in. Sometimes at the start of the game when the cops come to you with requests for a day off, or fewer working hours it’s good if you are able to give them that and keep them happy because later on when you have a barrage of 911 calls coming in, they will have your back and come through for you. But if you are a jerk and just make them work overtime from day 1 then expect them to leave you stranded when you need them the most. 

The game also checks your ability to weed out the bad cops. Some of the cops you get are just rotten apples. All they will ask for is time off and not really put in any effort. If you are unable to pick them out from the rest, then you will have a hard time at this game. But this is a fun mechanic as this game is primarily a management game.

Riot at a restaurant or just a long line?
Sometimes the game throws curve balls at you. For example, you will get a call about a riot in a public place but it will just be a large crowd waiting outside. You will have to be able to pick up on these small signs that tell you whether a 911 call is an actual emergency or a prank call. While this isn’t really that important at the beginning, later o, when you are getting call after call and can’t risk sending out officers for prank calls you better be ready. This is also taken to an extreme sometimes and breaks immersion. Some of the calls you get are just so unrealistic that it brings you back to reality that this is just a game. This is a small issue I have with this game, but it can be deal breaking for more hardcore players.

Same as the first game?
Well, not really. While it has the same systems, it also builds on those systems and improves them significantly. It also adds this new turn-based combat system that shows up randomly and only in specific firefight situations. And considering the price is quite low for this game I would say that they have done enough to warrant making a sequel.

Worth it or not?
In my opinion this game is definitely worth it. While it is quite a niche game, it also makes it welcome to newer players to the genre. This is a fun, little game that is also cheap. In my opinion the price fits the value offered and even though the game has a couple of negatives I have no issue recommending this fun game.

En ce qui concerne la durée de vie, tout dépend de votre capacité à résoudre les énigmes mais comptez une trentaine d'heure minimum pour résoudre les puzzles principaux.

Purchased for steam. Lots of hours playing, the game is a masterpiece. Specially for people of the 80s and 90s, that play everything except nowadays trash like fifa, fornite or call of duty, AIDS for gaming.
The graphics are awesowe, the game would.t be a hit with pixel art. Anyway you have the starring charactters handrawed, and the versions of Sor 1,2 and 3 in pixel art so no excuses.
The music is in the line of the saga, epic, brutal, a monster! Also you have the option to use old bgm of Sor 1 and 2, again no complains.
The game uses a new feature of combos, and is the base to understand the new mechanics. 
The levels are very different and long enough, we have 12 levels. 
The difficulty is a bit harder thatn previous games, with peaks of really easy to really hard (playing in normal). So if you don´t want to be slaughtered, I recommend you to start in easy, to understand the new enemies, mechanics and combos, and after the first completed game, go for normal.
A dream made true to all fans of this awesowe saga, 26 years waiting for it and it deserves the long wait.
Don´t doubt a second and get your copy, you won´t be disappointed, and extremely fun to play with friends. High replayability.",100

Amateur de Baldur's Gate, Fallout et Planescape Torment sans pour autant m'attendre à une révolution. Je me laisse doucement emporter vers la rive de Torment: Tides of Numerena. Cela commence fort et déjà quelques belles phrases attirent mon oeil expert mais... finalement l'histoire ne décolle jamais vraiment. Pourquoi ? La faute à un manque total d'action que, pourtant , je ne demande guère. C'est vous dire je fais aussi des story-telling point and click (Walking dead 1 et 2 excellents par exemple) mais là... Finalement, on a quelque chose de non approfondi, comme si les développeurs c'étaient concentrés à mort sur l'histoire (qui est sympa mais manque d'un peu de ""punch"") et les choix de dialogues en laissant totalement de coté le rythme de l'aventure par manque d'actions. Déception donc, même si le jeu se parcoure mais il finit par être embêtant (en 20 h ! Faut le faire).

Expliquons donc, les éléments qui fâchent :
- 20 h de jeu et j'ai déjà fini ! Pourtant je suis du genre à faire toutes les quêtes secondaires et essayer d'aller récupérer les trucs et les machins même en essayant de lire toutes les tonnes de textes qu'il y a.

- Baldurs Gate et Torment avaient l'avantage d'alterner phases de discussion, univers poussé et action combat. Ici, j'ai du faire une vingtaine de combats en 20 h = tu peux tout résoudre par des discussions sans fin avec des points (de comp que tu dépenses dans les dialogues), trop faciles à avoir. Oui parce que franchement je suis un adepte de l'écriture et de la lecture, non je vous jure, mais là ça en devient gonflant. J'ai souffert (beaucoup les dernières heures) en me forçant car je voyais venir la fin (qui d'ailleurs arrive comme un cheveu sur la soupe). Où est l'action !? Je peux passer 3 niveaux avec mon perso sans faire un seul combat ! Du coup, le plaisir de monter son personnage et de se sentir de plus en plus puissant ne vient pas car de toute façon tu ne l'utilises jamais à part pour dépenser des points dans les champs de dialogue = le parti pris est presque de faire un livre dont vous êtes le héros mais sur PC ! Vous lisez, vous sélectionnez les actions prédéterminées qui vous amènent à une autre option... Finalement, le sentiment de liberté ne vient pas (cela aurait pu être excellent alterner avec des combats avec des monstres même juste je sais pas sur une route... mais non) et...

- Le background ne suit pas, certes, il a un intérêt avec quelques rebondissements et révélations, mais, on kiffait l'univers drôle et décalé, les personnages loufoques, les éléments étranges de Planescape Torment, son coté un peu sale, son humour noir. Cet humour manque beaucoup, seul un compagnon à un petit coté cool de ce coté là (Erritis) mais il ne permet pas (et de loin vu la pauvreté d'approfondissement des aventures des PNJ compagnons) de rattraper ce manque. Planescape était plus long, plus profond et avec des combats ainsi qu'un vrai sentiment d'évolution. Je ne compare pas, mais une déception sur ce point. Pourquoi appeler cela ""Torment"" si en fait l'univers est très peu repris ?

- Car oui, si on compte, vous en aurez (en gros) pour 3 grands tableaux et grands lieux (certes détaillés et avec leurs histoires) mais c'est tout. On se sent donc un peu engoncé dans une fausse liberté (celle des dialogues où un énorme travail a été fait, mais ils auraient mérité moins de complexité et plus d'étalement, je me répète mais ""ponctué d'action"" et rencontres de monstres réguliers sur le chemin, pour passer une partie du temps des développeurs sur l'aventure, et l'aventure, ce n'est pas de passer son temps à parler à des mecs !)

Je suis donc en demi-teinte, en fait, je pense tout simplement qu'il ne vaut pas son prix c'est peut être là que le bat blesse à 20-25 euros oui, car on dirait le premier chapitre d'un épisode et un chapitre qui peine souvent à nous emmener. Si vous n'aimez pas la lecture (beaucoup), enfuyez-vous ! Moi je l'aime et j'ai fini en overdose. Le jeu a toutefois des cotés agréables et fouillés mais il laisse sur sa faim, on n'est pas ""emporté dans l'aventure"", on a plutôt l'impression de ""suivre"" même si je n'attendais pas une révolution. Prenez le en promo sur Steam cet été quand il sera à -50 ou -70 %.

A destination des développeurs (si certains lisent le français...) :

Le fait de l'Early Acces a pu aider ceux y jouant à passer des sas de décompression. Du dialogue... puis fin car le reste de l'univers n'est pas développé. Puis une autre petite partie en plus avec du dialogue... puis un arrêt. Ce phénomène a pu diriger les développeurs dans la mauvaise voie, par critiques successives des joueurs sur des ""bouts d'aventure"" avec des pauses, l'aventure d'ensemble et un recul global s'en est ressenti peut être. Cela a pu donner ce goût de surdose quand on fait l'aventure d'un coup ET d'inachevé car on sent que vous l'avez sorti pour la date... Quel dommage ! Le même avec plus de combats pour ponctuer l'aventure lui aurait donné une toute autre saveur, plus proche des ""sacro-saintes"" expériences des premiers émois des Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment et autres. Continuez comme ça, continuez à développer (on va dire que j'ai financé la bonne volonté) mais prenez en compte cet élément d'aventure, on veut ""vivre"" et ""ressentir"" cela passe par la ""réflexion"" et le ""dialogue"" mais aussi par le ""faire"" et l'""action"". Et pour Planescape faites nous ""rêvez"" comme vous l'avez fait, vos décors sont beaux, votre écriture bonne (même si le trop est l'ennemi du bien) mais il manque cet ""humour"" qu'on avait tant aimés.

If you just came from work and only want to relax, get it. I guess then it's a ""good"" game for you.

Literally nothing - not a single positive point comes in my mind for Battlefield V.
I am not going to explain why the game is one of the worst games ever developed & if you don't get why, please don't talk.
The actual best state of the game was after the release (Edited this review since then).

If you like this game; following things might be the reason:
- You are a casual & just want to play a game (that's totally okay btw)
- You were promoted/paid by EA/DICE to vote their game up (if so, no words for you)
- You started playing the BF franchise with Battlefield V and you have no idea what a good Battlefield is

Friendly reminder if you care about that point - Battlefield V reveal:
""There won't be any microtransactions! Everything can be unlocked trough just playing the game."" 
Well, take a look now ;)

Just don't .. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, NOR YOUR TIME. Why?
Worse than ever before. Just listing a few negative points:
- Lack of optimization 
- Bugs & glitches
- Complete mess called ""movement""
- Input delay
- Week for week new unplayable playlists
- no RSP with plugins
- In-game / weapon & vehicle balance 
- Countless cheater 
- Skill trees instead of weapon attachments 
- Level & unlock system
- In-game UI
- Random recoil of guns
- Gunplay in general
+ 5 points down below.
... the list could go on.

@DICE SW / EA - Keep doing what you do: Ignore constructive feedback and you ruin your studio(s) even more then you already do now.

Or instead: Shut down this garbage piece of sh*t and don't ever touch Battlefield again, since you love to ruin great games and or genres anyway.

@DICE LA - Fix this game, PLEASE.

Dropped score from 30 to 10. Would even go lower than 0 if possible.

Als ich nur noch mal kurz in die 360-Fassung reinschnuppern wollte, war plötzlich schon wieder eine komplette Stunde vergangen. Alien Breed: Impact ist spielerisch ebenso konservativ wie ideenarm und auch das Szenario wirkt ausgelutscht - trotzdem versinke ich sofort in einer anderen Welt, wenn ich mich auf die Jagd nach Außerirdischen begebe. Vermutlich liegt es daran, dass die Mischung aus schnellen Gefechten und dem ruhigem Entdecken verwaister Flure für einen ungemein motivierenden Spielfluss sorgt - kombiniert mit einer guten Portion Nostalgie. Und natürlich daran, dass die Raumstationen so stimmungsvoll inszeniert sind. Die Maschinen surren, Energietranformatoren fliegen unvermittelt in die Luft und die spinnenähnlichen Widersacher springen aufdringlich aus dem Lüftungsschacht - so muss Arcade-Action im All aussehen! Auf dem PC sind die SciFi-Kulissen sogar noch etwas hübscher gelungen. Nicht nur die Auflösung lässt sich höher schrauben, auch die Texturen und Animationen wurden einer dezenten Frischzellenkur unterzogen. Kleine spielerischen Neuerungen wie die Maus-Steuerung und das Aufmotzen der Waffen wirken ebenfalls sinnvoll. Die Entwickler hätten aber ruhig etwas mehr Abwechslung ins Spiel bringen können, z.B. durch mehr Bosskämpfe oder Rätsel. Besitzer einer Xbox 360 brauchen sich übrigens nicht zu ärgern, denn das Spielgefühl hat sich trotz der dezenten Neuerungen nicht geändert. Hier macht die Alien-Hatz immer noch beinah genau so viel Laune wie am PC.

Mittlerweile ist auch die PS3-Version im PSN-Store eingetrudelt. Inhaltlich entspricht sie der Steam-Fassung mit ihren Extras wie den Shop-Terminals, den grafisch verbesserten Aliens sowie den stimmiger beleuchteten Hintergründen. Besitzer der Sony-Konsole müssen allerdings mit kleinen technischen Abstrichen leben: Die Maus-Steuerung wurde natürlich gestrichen und stattdessen die Handhabung des Xbox 360-Originals übernommen. Auf der PS3 läuft der Held sogar eine Spur geschmeidiger durch die Raumstationen und auch die Bildrate ist höher als auf der Xbox 360 - allerdings nur so lange man nicht die Taschenlampe einschaltet. Das Licht überfordert offenbar die Grafik-Engine, so dass es beim Einsatz der Funzel zu Tearing und leichten Slowdowns kommt. Die technischen Mängel halten sich in einem erträglichem Rahmen, trotzdem sollten Grafik-Fetischisten zu den älteren Fassungen greifen, weil dort auch die Metalloberflächen in der Raumstation schärfere Texturen zu bieten haben.

This game was crowd funded and was very hyped leading up to its launch. So did it live up to it?

So, have you taken your Joy today?
The premise of the game is that Britain gave all of its children to Germany at the end of The World War.
You play as 3 different characters with different playstyles and story arcs. In this world everyone have to take an anti-depressant called Joy. 
The game has a beautifully designed dystopian open world that is very Orwellian. There are NPC’s called “Bobbies”(constables) that are there as enforcers. If they think someone isn’t taking their Joy then they go and correct that. Even in a small group they can be difficult to deal with. Even in everyone’s house’s there is this contraption known as a “Down Detector” that can detect if you are not taking your Joy and call the Bobbies on you.

Hey! You there, why are you running?!
In most games the NPCs will turn a blind eye to the fact that you are carrying a weapon and behaving oddly, but not in We Happy Few. Here, if you are running without reason in the city then the Bobbies will be after you. If you are walking around with a weapon then you better make sure no one spots you, unless you want to face the Bobbies again. 

Open up! I want my Blackberry Joy!

You play as 3 characters, Arthur, Sally and Ollie. Once you finish one character’s arc and are about to move onto the next you will be notified, as you will not be able to go back and play as the previous character. 
Each one of them has a different story and playstyle. 
For example, Sally(my favorite of the 3), is a chemist who has to stick to a schedule because the constables want her “Blackberry Joy” on a regular basis at a specific time, so you better make sure that you are ready with it on the dot. 
This is something you have to do in between everything else. 
The game also has a skill system and the skills offered are very apt to your situation, for example one of the perks lets you run without arousing suspicion. This is extremely useful as playing without this throughout the entire game may feel tedious as the mechanism of acting a character may get boring towards the end of the game, but this will let you be a bit more free. 
The game looks beautiful as well throughout the most parts with only some instances of texture issues.

What will the Down Detector say about this game?
What about the negatives? Well, right now there are few negatives. There are few bugs, but nothing major that would ruin your experience with the game.

Will I need to take some Joy to playthrough the game?
To sum it up, this game is one with lots of potential and ambition but sadly bugs ruin the perfect picture. If you love the idea of the game then you probably won’t regret getting.

Le bonheur de retrouver la NFL sur PC. Je n'avais pas acheté le précédent opus et cette année je me suis laissé tenter.
Graphiquement c'est beau, le gameplay n'a pas énormément évolué par rapport au dernier NFL auquel j'avais joué (NFL2004) je n'ai pas été perdu que ce soit sur les huddles ou de modifier le tracé d'un joueur offensif avant le snap.
En revanche j'ai vraiment été déçu du manque de modèle de jeu. Fini le mode propriétaire où l'on pouvait gérer tout le côté marketing de l'équipe (prix du sandwich dans le stade - pris de la place de parking / la mise à niveau du stade avec l'achat de nouveaux sièges ou enceintes dans le stade etc etc). Aujourd'hui on a le mode franchise qui consiste à faire des saisons toutes simples et le mode Ultimate Team à la Fifa :( 
Egalement déçu par le manque de réaction du public - autrefois lorsque le score était large à l'encontre de l'équipe qui évoluait à domicile, on pouvait voir le stade se vider au fur et à mesure qu'on avançait dans le temps. Ou même si les résultats étaient mauvais au fur et à mesure de la saison, le stade n'était jamais plein.
En conclusion: très content d'avoir à nouveau un madden NFL sur PC mais déçu sur le manque de possibilité en jeu.",60

doch einige Makel zeigen es wie Animation, Gesichts Ausdrücke etc... hätte man etwas daran arbeiten können!
Die Gesichter sehen wirklich leblos aus und es stört die Stimmung der Geschichte, wenn man es ernst nehmen will.

Controller, ist es sehr schwierig zum Zielen. irgendetwas stimmt mit der X Y Geschwindigkeiten nicht. Trotz das man die Steuerungen eingestellt hat hilft es wenig!

The gameplay is classical, you manage different aspects : food, natural ressources, politic (inside / outside), economic, ecologic etc etc . The game set a funny tone, all the characters are stereotype and have funny dialog. I really enjoy the fact that you evolve through time (if you have the DLC modern times). There is a lot of things to explain about the game so I make it quick : it's really a complete (if you have all the dlc) and funny game, the only thing that misses is building tunnels and bridges (that feature is available in Tropico 6).

Unlike the first two in the series the combat is now turn based and unlike the third (divinity 2), isometric rather then 3rd person.

And to be fair all the better for it.

OS is beautiful and intelligent game, with a lot of charm. Its very much story driven and does require a certain amount of player investment in following its intricate plot. Yes there's going to be plenty to read and lots of dialog to get through, but its mostly well written and enjoyable.

The world is incredibly interactive and one can spend an age just messing around with your inventory, crafting and experimenting with the items you find.

One important point to make is that OS does not hold your hand like many modern rpg's, it can at times feels a little overwhelming but with a little bit of reading and some lateral thinking the solution will present itself.
And talking of Solutions, there are often many different ways to achieve most things in the game, so creativity is often encouraged.

OS absolute win for me is the co-op multiplayer, its incredibly fun and entertaining to play with a friend. 
It is however a slow game and although screenshots may bring Diablo comparisons it does not share its pace.

So in summary:

+beautiful specially spell effects 
+fun turn based combat
+awesome co-op
+lots of dialog and story
+very interactive world and items

La trame principale est bien réussie, le monde est une nouvelle fois mis en danger par les supers vilains. Le joueur incarne une multitude d'incroyable supers héros afin de sauver la planète. De plus, il n'y a pas que le mode histoire dans ce jeu ; il existe aussi un mode libre où vous incarnez n'importe quel personnage de l'univers Marvel. Vous pouvez vous promener avec Iron Man volant et tirant des missiles sur tout le monde ou avec tante May, la célèbre tante de Spiderman !

Vous visitez l'île de Manhattan, avec l'ingrédient en plus, qui fait l'île de Marvel ; on peut y trouver la tour Stark, l’Astéroïde M, une base de Hydra abandonnée ainsi que le manoir X.

Les missions dans le jeu sont très bien faites. Il y a de la logique afin de passer les niveaux, beaucoup d'ennemis à battre et pratiquement un boss à vaincre après chaque niveau. Par contre, je trouve que battre les boss est assez ennuyant. C'est souvent la même manière de les vaincre ( je vous laisse voir pas vous même). Mais malgré tout, le jeu est vraiment bien et attractif.

Bien sur il n’existe pas que le mode histoire. Vous pouvez faire des missions secondaires dans le mode libre afin d'avancer dans votre progression et débloquer des personnages. 

Graphiquement, pour un jeu Lego, les graphismes sont très beau, ce n'est bien évidemment pas des graphismes extraordinaires comme les dernières nouveautés mais plutôt des graphismes du style « animé jeux vidéos ». Le jeu est très fluide et il ne demande pas une grande puissance venant de votre ordinateur.

Si vous comptez jouer sur clavier et à la souris à ce jeu, et bien, comment dire ? C'est impossible ; la maniabilité de ce jeu est horrible si vous comptez rester sur clavier. Sur ce genre de jeu, il vaut mieux brancher une manette afin de profiter à 100% du jeu.

En conclusion,ce jeu est, selon moi, très bien pour tout fan de super héro. Ce jeu est attractif et le mode libre avec la multitude de personnages donne beaucoup de charme au jeu. ",90

It is a must buy for every DBZ fan (and not only) who can afford it. 

Storyline 10/10

I really like the idea of the storyline. Basically, you make your own character (you can choose between Saiyan, Human, Majin, Namekian and Freeza's race) and you travel in time with Trunks because some of the events are changing (for example Vegeta kills everyone when he first arrives on Earth) so you have to help. Those changes are caused by 2 persons which appear only in the game. You can also do parralel quests either alone or with other players and you can even speak with them. This game is playable both online and offline ( you can play it with a friend if you have 2 controllers).

Graphics 8/10

It kind of resemble the original series so it's not the best one. I like the fact that you have better combat system and far more abilities.

Themes / music 8/10

I don't really like the in-game themes but the intro is really awesome (at least for me).

Overall 9/10

A good thing is that you can select the voice language (English or Japanese). Some characters can be unlocked only when you meet certain requirements. Most of the abilities (if not all) can be bought from the in-game store a certain amount of in-game currency (Zeni, so you don't need real money), for example Super Saiyan (ultimate ability) can be bought when you reach a certain level (16 I think) for 50000 Zeni. It can only be purchased by the ones who made a character from the Saiyan race. It also respects the original one so it drains your Ki pretty quickly. Overall, the game is really nice and you have a lot of things to do in it.

The Character level system is intuitive and fun since you have to earn souls by killing enemies and then sell them to Vulgrim to upgrade your level giving you a skill point you can spend freely on the 3 Attributes health, Strength and Magic, all enhancing the character in the long run.
The story is great and builds on the story of Darksiders 1 and 2.

Surprisingly, Capcom also finally managed to write good netcode. Actually, it's not just good, it's great. Maybe not quite on par with Killer Instinct (which is as good as it gets as far as fighting game netcode is concerned), but it's actually quite close, and years ahead of the garbage that was Street Fighter V's netcode.

Eigentlich eine sehr gute Kombination. In der Theorie zumindest. denn gerade mit diesem Geschöpf der Nacht wäre einiges drin gewesen um dem Genre frisches Blut zu verabreichen (und nicht allein der mit guten Eckzähnen versehenen Kreatur). Leider ist ""Dark"" ein weiteres von vielen traurigen Beispielen vergeudeten Spiel-Potentials. Was auf den ersten Blick interessant klingt und dank Cel-Shading-Optik ebenso aussieht, entpuppt sich sehr schnell als ärgerliches Trial-and-Error-Erlebnis mit monotonem Spielaufbau und überaus spannungsfreier 08/15-Handlung.

Story:
Eric Bane wacht in einer Gothic-Disco namens Sanctuary auf - und hat gleich ein dickes Problem am Hals. Man hat ihn zum Vampir wider Willen gemacht, und wenn er nach Aussage anderer freundlich gesinnter Blutsauger nicht schnellstens seinen ""Erschaffer"" findet und zum (unfreiwilligen) Aderlass bittet, kann er sich auf eine unschöne Verwandlung zum Ghul, einem Zombie-ähnlichen Vampir-Wesen, einstellen. Will er das? Natürlich nicht, und damit beginnt eine Jagd nach dem ihn rettenden Lebenssaft und der Wahrheit hinter seiner ""Vampirisierung""...

Wer sich viel mehr von der Handlung erhofft, darf sich auf bitterste Enttäuschung gefasst machen. Sie kommt leider nie über den ""Ist ja ganz nett""-Ansatz hinaus und will mit seiner übertriebenen Coolness, übelsten Figuren-Klischees und strunzdummen Dialogen nie so richtig gefallen. Die Entwickler packen das trendige Vampir-Szenario völlig falsch an. Fesselnde Atmo? Horror-Stimmung? Nope. Dafür ein arg formelhaftes Abklappern von Level zu Level (""Ober-Vampir 1 war das falsche Ziel, also zum Nächsten... Ach verdammt, der war es auch nicht, dann wohl Numero 3..."" *schnarch*), wodurch sich das (wenn überhaupt vorhandene) Interesse an der zusammenhanglosen Story schnell ins Nirgendwo verliert.

Große Mitschuld trägt auch die miserable Sprachausgabe von ""Dark"", denn mit Ausnahme des Protagonisten-Stimmgebers müssen die restlichen Sprecher wohl selbst gerade frisch aus dem Sargpolster erwacht sein. Anfangs dachte ich noch, als ich in der Eric-Bane-Stimme den ""Adam Jensen""-Synchro-Typen aus ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution"" heraushörte:
""Oha! Könnte zumindest akustisch ein Hochgenuss werden.""
Tja, der positive Ersteindruck sollte sich nicht lange halten. Vielleicht lag es an den öden Texten oder der allgemein drögen Charalterzeichnung Eric Banes, aber jener Mann hinterm Mikro hat hier bei weitem nicht die gleiche Leidenschaft gezeigt wie in Eidos' meisterhaftem Cyberpunkt-Rollenspiel. Von den anderen Synchronsprecher will ich erst gar nicht anfangen, ich will nichtmal wissen wo diese überhaupt aufgegabelt wurden. Nach professionellem oder gar erfahrenem Personal klang das definitiv nicht.
Was aber am meisten nervt: Diese schnelle Satz-auf-Satz-Folge ohne Atempause. Wer auch immer die Sprachsamples zusammengeschnitten hat, ich kann nur hoffen dass es dessen allerletzte Mischpult-Arbeit war. Das ist purer Folter für die Spieler-Ohren.

Von den Werbe-Screenshots zu ""Dark"" darf man sich ebenfalls nicht blenden lassen. Der Cel-Shading-Comic-Look mag auf seine Art angenehm anders, begrenzt stimmig und eigenständig sein, an den Schwächen der Engine gibt es dennoch nichts schönzureden. Gesichter ohne eine einzige Gefühlsregung, altbackende Effekte, übelst unscharfe Texturen und allgemeine Detailarmut wo man sich nur umschaut. Dazu noch jede Menge Clipping-Fehler und falsche Darstellungen gewisser Animationen (man beachte wie Bane seinen Opfern das Blut abzapft, ohne auch nur deren Hälse zu berühren... :-B). Das einzig Positive an der Engine von ""Dark"": Sie hat keinen allzugroßen Hardware-Hunger.

Den letzten Tiefschlag verpasst ""Dark"" allen Käufern mit seinem miesen Gameplay. Obwohl als Schleich-Spiel geworben, macht Stealth-Taktik - so wie man sie eigentlich versteht - in diesem Spiel nur bedingt, manchmal sogar keinen Sinn. Eine überlegte Vorgehensweise ist selten notwendig, oftmals gar nicht möglich, weil unübersehbare KI-Schwächen der Gegner nur durch deren erhöhte Präsenz ausgeglichen wurden. Wegen teils unfair gehaltener Level-Strukturen und Dutzender Klon-Wachen, die auf engstem Raum ihre Routen ziehen, spart man sich das Umherschleichen und knockt lieber einen KI-Deppen nach dem anderen aus und versteckt seinen Leichnam außer Sicht seiner Kollegen. Die meisten von Banes Vampir-Spezialfähigkeiten, die man im Laufe des Spiels RPG-like nach und nach erwirbt, haben durchaus ihre Daseinsberechtigung und lockern das Spielgeschehen ein wenig auf, doch richtig elegante Taktiken lassen sich wegen der nicht selten ungenauen Steuerung mehr schlecht als recht umsetzen. Durch den künstlich hochgesetzten Schwierigkeitsgrad und nur zwei verfügbaren Speicherplätzen pro Levelanschnitt (auf mittlerer Stufe) erreicht der Frust-Faktor sein endgültiges Höchstmaß. Respekt all denen, die all das nicht abschrecken kann - trotz meiner freundlich gemeinten Warnung.

Fazit:
Zu meinem Glück war es nur ein Fünfer den ich für dieses ""Dark"" verbraten hab. Mit dem Konzept und dem im Stealth-Genre eher unverbrauchten Vampir-Setting hätte vielleicht was Gescheites herauskommen können, aber bei der Umsetzung wurde so ziemlich alles schlecht wie falsch gemacht. Der Plot, die Charaktere, die Spielmechanik, die Technik - nix davon löste während der gut 12-stündigen Gesamtspieldauer Begeisterungsstürme in mir aus.
Wer wirklich NICHTS im Stealth-Segment auslassen möchte, bitte, der tue es sich gerne an. Ich rate lieber zu etablierten Marken (""Splinter Cell"" ""Thief"", ""Hitman"" o.ä.) oder besonders empfehlenswerten Indie-Hits wie ""Mark of the Ninja"", denn dort ist jeder einzelne Euro wesentlich besser angelegt.",30

Call of Duty: Ghosts is here and is really in the ordinary Call of Duty-fashion.

""So we can't change too many of the core rules, and the core rules are really simple. You're a player, it's in first-person, you have a weapon in your hand and you run around shooting other people."" 

The words above come from Infinity Wards executive producer Mark Rubin and is about the Call of Duty series. He draws a parallel between the incredibly popular game series and football, and says that if one of the sport's suddenly decided to only have seven players on the pitch and that you also get to use your hands, the people would loose interest and stop attending matches.
This conservative philosophy exist for the huge crowd of fans of the series who will recognize it and not get lost in strange novelties. 
And it has left a distinct mark on the new addition to Call of Duty: Ghosts, as in every way, this is exactly what one would expect of a new game in the series.

The campaign begins in an idyllic American place where you sit and talk with your father and brother.
In ordinary Call of Duty-fashion, there are not many minutes before the first explosion color the sky red and the everything falls into chaos. 
Bombs are slamming into the right and left, buildings destroyed before your eyes and you have to survive at any cost.
It starts out pretty good with a premise that arouses interest. 
The South American Federation takes control of the weapon Odin and kills millions of American citizens with bombs. When they have the upper hand they invade the injured shot nation that relies on it feared special dressing Ghosts to turn things around and win the war against all odds.

The campaign is just as exciting and intense as one would expect, with so many explosions that you almost get a nice tan in front of the screen. In a never-ending stream of scenes, we take us through runaway trains, drive a snowmobile across frozen lakes, deep dive among sharks and visit the vacuum of space while we are shooting thousands of opponents to death.
But unfortunately, while the campaign is very full of action, it's completely brain dead. 
Some scenes are so stupid that I just laugh out straight. Clichés succeed each other and to say the least incredible sequence of events is explained with intrigue that could have been written by monkeys at the zoo. 
Or how about a good guy transformed into a vicious sadist who's fed with crops from the South American 

And we have it here with the Call of Duty dog. Infinity Ward assured that we would care about this mutt that comes with along the way, but that is not the case, and the question is rather if they tried to achieve that goal at all. My dog is acting in a fairly useless in a Supporting Role as quickly wasted and then fall in total oblivion. Infinity Ward know their explosions and ""follow the leader with Weapons"" torques, but to tell a believable and interesting story, they really can't.
Fortunately, the multiplayer is still the series' strengths and savior. For the most part, I'm having a lot of fun with the various play modes. My favourite mode is ""hunted"" - a situation where one armed with a pistol at the beginning of the round and then must collect crates to get access to better firepower. Free for all on the game's smallest maps are wonderfully chaotic with the perfect balance between chance and skill.

For me, standing just outside the core group who love the series for what it is, it becomes problematic with few functioning news. Should not a giant company, Activision, with all the money resounding success of Call of Duty draws in, deliver something bigger? Something that makes me lose my breath as nails sticking controller in my hands and pushing me to defy feelings of fatigue and hunger?
There are probably things you don't have time for when a new game is to be replaced every year - then it might just be more of the same. 
Which in the case of Call of Duty: Ghosts works very well because its heart-racing action as the series' hallmark still stands up so well in the competition and delivers an entertaining multiplayer experience.

Néanmoins, oui car tout n'est pas parfait dans ce pack, je dirais qu'il faut réfléchir à ce qu'on attend vraiment des Sims avant de l'acheter. Gérer l'empreinte écologique de tous nos mondes est vraiment intéressant, et le fait d'avoir un projet communautaire pour lesquels nos sims d'un même monde doivent se rencontrer, échanger entre eux pour gagner des points d'influence sur les votes de projet est intéressant.

Recycler des objets, c'est bien, mais je m'imagine mal passer mes journées ""sims"" à faire ça, et on fait vite le tour des nouvelles activités. De plus, l'empreinte écologique de ce que j'ai pu en voir, change très vite et c'est compliqué de gérer la vie de nos sims (leur travail, leurs relations, les autres activités..) et leur rôle dans cette empreinte écologique.

Le gameplay est malheureusement insipide les 3/4 du temps, répétitif et inutilement punitif en prime, quoique proposant une variété plus qu'appréciable de compétences et de personnalisation de notre chère Ayumi.
L'histoire est totalement anecdotique, creuse et plus que dispensable. Ils auraient très bien pu enlever les cinématiques, ça nous aurait juste fait gagner quelques minutes de jeu.
Les graphismes du jeu sont clairement en retard, mais restent agréables et honnêtes.
Les musiques sont sans âme, se résumant a du rock-électro-métal dégueulasse qu'un gothique cliché aurait pu mettre sur son Skyblog... et si vous vous posez la question : oui ce truc existe encore.

CONCLUSION : Un meilleur gameplay aurait été LARGEMENT suffisant pour rendre ce jeu mémorable, mais il en fut hélas autrement.
Si vous aimez les héroïnes sexy avec une vraie personnalité et des compétences variées, le tout dans un jeu plutôt correct graphiquement parlant... FONCEZ.
Mais si comme moi vous voyez le gameplay comme une composante INDISPENSABLE d'un bon jeu... PASSEZ VOTRE CHEMIN.

Cela dit, je retiens Ayumi en mémoire... j'irai voir plus tard... sur la fameuse règle 34 d'internet... héhé :p",30

Gameplay découverte du jeu en vidéo ci-dessus :)

Mes premières impressions sont bonnes. En effet, dans We Are The Revolution le joueur incarne un juge durant la révolution Française. Le joueur devra prendre connaissance des dossiers en cours, tenter de reconstituer les faits réels par le biais d'un résumé de l'accusation, vous devrez également faire l'interrogatoire de l'accusé afin d'éclaircir vos premiers éléments de preuves. La cour exigera ainsi une sentence. Sentence que vous pourrez suivre où ne pas suivre si vous estimez que l'accusé est honnête et les éléments de preuve insuffisants. Mais attention, les décisions que vous prendrez auront des incidences sur la cour où sur le peuple pouvant mener à votre propre chute. Il faudra pour ainsi dire prendre en considération l'opinion générale pour se maintenir en poste.

Curious as to what this exactly means? Read on! You start off with a small group of survivors on a foreign planet. You have to ensure they survive and maybe even start their own settlement/civilisation so that they can thrive!

A completely customisable experience
When you start a fresh game, you are given a huge variety of options to customise your experience. You can change difficulties, your starting location, your survivors’ backstory and so much more. The biggest aspect of this has to be the ‘Storytellers’ but more on this in the next section. If you want to play a game while laid back on a Sunday afternoon then you can make this game so, if you want a challenging experience that keeps you on your toes then you can customise this game to be just that. It’s all left to you.

Emergent Story
This is a big selling point for this game. Each time you play this game, irrespective of your customisation choices, it feels different, and this is why. This is also the place where your choice of Storyteller matters. You are given quite a few choices. But first, what exactly are these storytellers and why do they matter so much? Your storyteller is basically the narrator of your adventures. You have a wide variety of options. You can choose one that doesn’t really give you any challenges ensuring a more “laid back” experience. You can choose one that gives you challenges at regular intervals. And best of all, if you are up for the challenge, you can choose the storyteller that has no rules! They throw everything at you irrespective of your progression, forcing you to find innovative and unique solutions. 

This simple element to the game ensures that even if you customise two games exactly the same with even the same storyteller, you will almost certainly still have a different experience. 

Doesn’t it look a little too much…like something familiar?
Funnily, it does and the game you are thinking of is Prison Architect (another fantastic game). There actually is a reason for this and that is the developers made a deal allowing Rimworld to use some of the assets. Now for some people this may make the game feel a little unique and that may be a negative but I think I speak for most PC gamers who love indies that despite the lack of uniqueness, the game’s art-style is still a thing of beauty and can be considered a positive rather than a negative! But at the end of the day, the aesthetics of the game is something very subjective and it is up to you to decide, but I for one am a big fan of this kind of art-style.

HOURS of content at your fingertips
This game, thanks to its customisation features and emergent story mechanic, offers hundreds of hours of content with tons of re-playability. If you are wondering whether this game is value for money, don’t worry, you will most likely not find a game that offers more value for its price tag than Rimworld. This is a fantastic indie gem and a true masterpiece.

Das Spiel befindet sich aber noch im Early-Access und es wird weiter daran gearbeitet. Zum Beispiel gibt es bald einen neuen Skirmish Modus in dem ich sehr viel Hoffnung habe, da der reguläre Modus zwar ganz nett ist, aber eben stark an ein Handy-Spiel erinnert und meiner Meinung nach zwar nicht schlecht ist, aber auch nicht wirklich gut. Der Singleplayer besteht aus wenigen, schweren und dadurch relativ langen Missionen die man noch verbessern könnte aber dennoch spaßig sind. Die Grafik ist nicht wirklich gut, was mich kaum stört aber trotzdem ein Minuspunkt ist. Gelegentlich gibt es Bugs wodurch man das Spiel neu starten muss, worüber ich mal hinweg sehe, da sich das Spiel noch im Early-Access befindet.

This remake was developed by Purple Lamp Studios, and published by THQ Nordic, who you might know from Darksiders, great game. 

The game was released for PC, Xbox One and PS4, but I’ve only played it on PC so I can’t tell you what performance is like on other platforms. Also worth noting this isn’t a comparison review, it’s a review of the remake, and yes there will be a few comparisons, maybe. 
Let’s move on to Story & Gameplay. 

STORY AND GAMEPLAY

So this being a SpongeBob game, you should expect a SpongeBob story, meaning a silly, ridiculous and nonsensical story. And that’s exactly what it is: Plankton wants to take over using robots, but fails terribly when he forgets to set the robots to “Obey” mode, and it’s up to SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy, to save Bikini Bottom.

Like I said, it’s a spongebob game, and story wise, it’s got everything you could possibly expect from a spongebob story. It’s just pure silliness, that’s all. It’s not gonna be for everyone, obviously if you don’t like SpongeBob, well I’d say you’ll quickly get annoyed by the childishness of the game. And I’ll be honest, sometimes SpongeBob’s laugh or the humour of the game got on my nerves a bit, but I felt like it was a bit unfair to complain since that’s literally what SpongeBob is, silly childish humour. 

Other than that there really isn’t much else to say about the story. The game is divided into the three sections of Bikini Bottom, and each section contains several areas for you to explore. In each of these areas you can switch between certain characters to solve certain puzzles, and your goal is essentially to find as many Golden Spatulas so you can open other areas. You usually will be getting these by completing little objectives or collecting objects, but you can also trade currency and collectibles for them too. By the way, there’s a total of 10 areas, and most of them have other characters in them which’ll give you mini objectives to complete for a spatula.

So there’s actually quite a fair amount to do, really. Naturally, it’s not an open world game filled with side quests and whatnot, but it’s got a good amount of content. There’s also a few bosses you get to fight. In terms of how the game actually plays, well, like I said you get to control three characters, Spongebob, sandy and patrick, and they’ve each got different attack sets, and Spongebob can learn different moves throughout the game. That’s pretty much it.

Gameplay wise the game really isn’t complicated, it’s a mix of simple combat and platforming, and it works very well for this particular game. You’ve gotta remember, it was probably aimed at younger audiences, so it’s just important to take the game for what it is.

The game also ran very smoothly, I never had any crashes or fps drops or anything like that.

I do have one or two complaints though, which I think are reasonable, since these concern the technical aspect of the game. I did encounter some bugs such as getting stuck here and there, and my only other complaint, is that the game tends to reset progress for some objectives sometimes. I’m not talking about enemies here, that respawn when you exit an area, but sometimes the game would reset some progress I’d made because I died, and it could be a bit frustrating at times, admittedly. 

Other than that, really nothing bad to say. Typical spongebob story accompanied by simple, fluid gameplay. Pretty chill and easy going on the whole. 

VISUALS

When it comes to visuals & graphics, I must say this game looks pretty good. It’s to be expected, of course, we are in 2020 after all, but the game looks very visually pleasing, and the colour palette is one my eyes certainly enjoyed. The colours didn’t feel over saturated, they didn’t pop out too too much, it was just a very nice look for game. 

It’s also a pretty good improvement from the original game, which is also to be expected. The character models are a lot more detailed, I’ll try and put up some pictures so you guys can see, but each character’s models is really nicely done, and looks a lot more like the show than they did in the original. Animations are very clean too, and the characters you play also have idle animations which I thought was pretty cool. 

So very nice visuals on the whole, didn’t have issues such as texture popping or blurry textures, everything looked really nice, and the colours were really pleasing. 

SOUND & MUSIC

Alright, music! Well, like a lot of other aspects of this game, the game’s music is really what you would expect from it. Obligatory, the Spongebob theme song is in the game, but other than that you have your typical Spongebob music, with the hawaiian ish guitar usually leading. This is usually the case for the game’s hub, Bikini Bottom, but each area has got its little soundtrack too. 

As for sound, it’s very cartoon ish, as you might expect. For example, a spring noise for jumping, the boing noise, the slap noise for attacking, things like that. 

Regarding sound and music, I don’t have much else to say. The game’s sound design is on the whole pretty good, nothing spectacular of course, but definitely nice to listen to. 

FINAL THOUGHTS & OPINION

Well, this was a relatively short review I’d say, and I know I’ve said this a few times already, but this game is exactly what you would expect from a Spongebob game. I saw a lot of people hating on the game for being dumb and whatever, but like, that’s exactly what Spongebob is. 

So just keep this in mind when buying the game, it is mostly aimed at people who like Spongebob, and well, naturally, it’s gonna have Spongebob things, such as silly humour, dum dum characters and a ridiculously absurd story. 

However, I don’t wanna gatekeep this game, and I do think that if you’re into platforming games and just want a relaxing, chill time, then this game might be for you. It can actually get somewhat challenging at times, if you’ve watched my let’s play you’ll know I actually died a few times, and I can’t tell if that’s embarrassing or not. 

Again, keep in mind this is a spongebob game, and it’s exactly what you would expect from a spongebob game, pure silliness and simple fun. If you can’t accept that, you’ll get annoyed very easily. 
Overall, very fun and chill game, and a great improvement over the original game, mostly on the visual side of things. 

That’s gonna be it for my review, I hope it wasn’t too short, but really there’s only so much I can talk about concerning this game, and I feel like I’ve said what I needed to. Again, remember it’s a spongebob game, not some full blown action rpg with amazing mechanics.",90

When starting the game, you have a selection of three difficulties normal, hard and very hard, there is also an iron mutant to choose which introduces perma-death, no manual saving, auto saves after every combat.

More casual or hard-core player base?
The thing this game does different compared to other turned-based strategy games is that you take full control of your team of three mutant stalkers and traveling around a map exploring freely until you find a group of enemies, the player then can go into stealth switch off flash lights and placing your squad in positions that the player thinks is the best for the once in combat the game turns into a turn based game. The game in my experience teaches the player in the first mission the controls and mechanics really well, so it is easy to pick up for those who will be playing a turn-based action game for the first time quite easily
The flow of the game is set at a good pace while free roaming it allows the player to appreciate the environment that is over grown and desalinate from the post-apocalypse around them listening to the spoken dialog for the story, the camera while free roaming is set at a third person view seeing all three characters. This allows players to think strategically on what is the best weapon to use, what tactics player should use and what character skills to use on certain enemy’s during the game.

How It Works
The game has a gear system to take in consideration equipping the characters with what best suits them and for the situation choosing from weapons, armor and headgear. The weapons are pistols, shotguns, assault rifles and sniper rifles there is a total of 15 weapons to choose from and find during the game each with its own damage, critical damage, critical chance ammo, range and if it comes with a silencer or can knockback and destroy cover. The armor you can choose from comes with some armor bonuses, HP bonuses and special effects ranging from immunity to critical hits, increased throwing range and absorbing explosive damage. The head-gear you can choose from comes with special effects such as +25 weapon range, immune to critical hits, +2 grenade damage and more.
You gain experience points after winning fights you encounter to put into the skill tree choosing mutations and abilities each character has eight available mutations and five permanent stat bonuses. Each character can have three active skills at a time, one for a main skill, one for a minor skill and one for a passive skill, for example one main skill can allow the player to use chain lighting during combat to hit a group of enemies in one turn, one minor skill can allow the player to use chameleon becoming invisible until attacking , one passive skill can allow the player to reach high places by moving or sprinting in combat, each playable character has a different skill tree to upgrade and learn.

Is it worth picking up?
I think it is, even for those who are new to this genre of game, it has a lot of charm to it from the story, gameplay, sound design and visual design. Definitely worth picking up for fans of turn-based combat and those who are new to the genre.

------------------------------------------------------

Attention, je ne viens pas cracher sur ce jeu, encore moins sur la licence, son ambiance, sa mécanique ou son orientation.
J'évoque mon ressenti sur un rapport qualité-prix, et, forcément, je compare. J'ai commencé à jouer en 1990.

Tu ne peux pas demander autant d'argent (même la version de base à 36€ un an après la sortie) pour un produit aussi léger.
Pense qu'un ""Final Fantasy"", un ""Tales of..."", n'est jamais aussi cher, et pourtant la qualité te saute aux yeux, que ce soit techniquement, artistiquement ou au niveau du système de jeu, ou même des DLC (exemple : ""Berseria"").

Je n'ai touché à Ryza qu'une bonne heure, mais ce que j'ai vu, entendu et palpé, me semble très très en dessous du prix exigé.
Koei-Tecmo, qui je le rappelle, sont connus pour leurs prix exorbitants et leurs DLC à date de péremption, va vous la mettre comme il faut, ou plutôt ""komifo"", comme on dit à Vierzon.

On commence ?
*craquements de doigts*

=> Cinématique d'intro et suivantes inintéressantes : c'est l'été, on se fait ch*er, y'a rien à faire au village, si on allait voir le nouveau marchand qui vient d'arriver ? Pas trop le temps de présenter les persos, on y va.

=> Allers-retours en suivant l'icône de la map, sans cesse. Si tu veux aller voir ailleurs, on te rappelle à l'ordre. C'est pas par là, voyons.

=> Murs invisibles (j'adore)

=> Saut complètement WTF (il faut la voir sauter, pour le croire, indescriptible : elle est comme poussée en avant par un coup de vent mou, avec un bruitage Swhhh juste inacceptable, surtout en combo avec un mur invisible).

=> Textures très variables, un côté Playstation 2 ou 3 par moments (particulièrement le sol et les arrière-plans)

=> Les PNJS croisés n'ont pas souvent quelque chose à dire, ils disparaissent même si on s'approche trop près -!-

=> Animations très sommaires, surtout lors des dialogues (vaut mieux ne pas regarder les bouches...)

=> Les personnages sont partiellement animés, vous verrez certaines parties du corps (par exemple les 2 mèches qui pendent et les deux seins qui boiiing-boiiiing, sur Ryza) mais le reste est totalement immobile, figé. Les persos ne sont pas très bien intégrés aux décors non plus. Le character design fait passer ""Dragon Quest XI"", ""Tales of ce-que-tu-veux"" et même ""Final Fantasy X"" pour des chefs d'oeuvre dignes du Louvre.

=> Prends ta dose d'aliasing sur l'herbe, c'est offert (aucune option ne permet de le vaincre)

=> Proportions très spéciales : la caméra se fixe bien juste sous les fesses de Ryza, mais il ne faut pas demander à regarder trop haut, trop bas, y'a pas, et en combat, le postérieur de notre charmante villageoise est carrément devant le caméra, on a limite envie de lui demander de se pousser.

=> Doublage japonais correct, sous-titres EN PLEIN MILIEU DE L'ECRAN (on a jamais vu ça nulle part)

=> Ryza est certes une villageoise très avenante, parce qu'elle a deux gros arguments qui se balancent quand elle court, mais elle est escortée par un grand dadais bien niais et un corniaud qui a un look de victime de harcèlement scolaire. Pas très dur de briller au milieu des déchets. Je sais bien qu'on est censés s'attacher à la bande, qui s'agrandit par la suite, mais très honnêtement ils n'ont rien à dire d'intéressant. Mettez côte-à-côte la première heure sur ""Final Fantasy XIII"" et celle de Ryza. Que constatez-vous ? sans commentaire.

=> Les combats sont mous du genou, commencent par un bon gros blur, se terminent sur un bon vieux flash blanc (imaginez pendant 100h), et lorsqu'on attend son tour, à part reluquer les fesses de Ryza... remarque, oui, je comprends... mais... donne moi quelque chose à faire quand même.

Vous l'aurez compris, pour moi c'est refund / remboursement, et je ne suis pas sûr de pouvoir me faire rembourser les DLCs honteux que j'ai ajoutés à mes frais du jour.

Bien sûr, l'alchimie a l'air sympa, les combats semblaient prometteurs, et l'enrobage tout mignonnet, sur une aventure d'été avec des gros seins, c'est sûrement agréable, je ne dis pas le contraire.

Mais f*ck Koei-Tecmo, ses prix délirants, et sa finition risible.

First off you need to know that when looking at the story mode alone you will spend a whole lot of time just reading and listening to characters for the story in a visual novel style like many anime games do nowadays. The problem with this is that it takes up about 80% of the story and only maybe 20% are spend actually playing the game. It can be that you will have 5~15 mins (ish) of visual novel only to then play a mission for less than 2 mins (less than 1 min in the early game).

This game is also very easy so I suggest to turn up the difficulty to ""hard"" so it isn't as boring especially in the beginning of the game. It gets more difficult as you continue.

Personally I finished the story in around 8 hours because I payed attention to the story in the beginning but then decided to skip it all later which means that you can probably add some hours on top if you watch all interactions.

Next to the story you have optional missions you can tackle to get materials to upgrade all of the characters and eventually also marry them.
These are also very easy and only take up your time at the last few missions because special enemys just become very tanky whilst minions still die very quick.

There is also a photomode if you want to take some pictures of the ships of which there are 25 playable ones and also have several support characters you can't play that also never show up in missions.

There are also 27 achievements that are quite easy to get and after 25 hours of game time I managed to get all of them.

Performance wise is decent enough. It didn't crash on me once or had any bugs and glitches. However the performance in mission would dip at times when a lot was going on. Besides that it very good.

In summary I would say that if you are an Azur Lane fan you could certainly take a look at it. But I would definately not recommend this game with its base price but try to buy it at a reduced price.
Other than that it may not be worth it for other people due to its repetetive nature and in my opinion little value.",40

This game is a legit copy of NBA 2K19, there are even banners ingame that have 2k19 written all over them. How do people even get paid for making low/no-effort software like this?

Don't buy this game at any given chance, they will backstab you later once all the money is flowing in for 2k.

La historia, si bien simple y clara, se desarrolla a buen ritmo y con giros sin perder de vista las historias personales de los compañeros, que son igual de interesantes y que tienen un impacto en la relación que tienen con el protagonista. La historia es más similar a la de DAO, por lo que es claro que están volviendo a sus raíces. Pero no os engañéis, tiene mucho más micro-historias, dobles verdades y mitología de lo que primeramente se ve. Los escritores han hecho un gran trabajo, especialmente con cierto personaje.

Los personajes son increíbles, mucho mejores que sus antecesores, y con una variedad muy interesante, incluso en gusto por romance, lo que los hace estar mejor construidos y darles un punto más veraz. Los banters entre ellos son diversos, aunque me habría gustado que hubiera más, ya que saltan cada 20min aproximadamente y es mucho tiempo. Los romances con ellos son interesantes, emocionan y divierten. Lo bueno es que tus compañeros pueden enamorarse entre sí si no haces romance con ellos, lo cual añade una profundidad a la historia y a la realidad de la misma (no todos los PJ tienen que estar enamorados del protagonista).

El modo de combate está muy mejorado, es divertido y tiene una cámara táctica como en DA2, lo cual permite dar órdenes a los compañeros de manera más sencilla o, si nos gusta la estrategia, pues más clara. Siguen las combinaciones de poderes entre clases, así como la especialización de la clase del protagonista. Lo bueno de la especialización es que podemos ""probarla"" antes ya que cada compañero es un ejemplo de su clase. (Ejemplo: Cole, Sera y Varric son pícaros; Cole = asesino, Sera = Tempestad, Varric = Artífice).

El ambiente es de los más hermosos y mejores que he visto, están muy detallados y muy conseguidos. Hay lugares donde dan ganas de perderse y quedarse solo observando el lugar. Además, hay mucha variedad: desde páramos helados, a bosques, llanuras, pantanos y desiertos (cada uno de ellos desatando banters al respecto por parte de los compañeros de equipo). Los mapas son abiertos y libres de ser explorados, además de grandes, posiblemente ""The Hinterlands"" (primer mapa) sera el más grande y tedioso de todos.

La música es una delicia, un poco repetitiva en el estilo, pero cuidada y tratada con mimo. Me encanta el cambio de música en Orlais con su toque ""francés"" y las canciones de taverna.

Un juego 100% recomendable, una pedazo de obra maestra del RPG!",100

Estaba ayer mirando juegos en la sección Indie, a ver que encontraba y tuve bastante suerte. No tenía ni idea de la existencia de este titulo, pero si eres fan de los juegos de mesa....TE VA A GUSTAR.

Tiene un sabor a juego de mesa antiguo muy diferenciado, tanto en su apartado artístico, como en su jugabilidad (ya que no se regala la victoria, el juego disfruta jodiéndote). Cuentas con 14 personajes bastante diferenciados(con sus raciales únicas) con los que moverte por el tablero e intentar llegar a la corona, desde esta, podrás destruir a tus enemigos si la suerte está contigo claro. Para llegar a la corona, debes pasar por varias regiones, la más exterior, donde hay aldeas, tabernas, campos con enemigos... La siguiente región cuenta con la puerta que tienes que lograr abrir para llegar a la última parte... Lo más parecido a Mordor, ya que en esta región todo lo que te puede pasar es malo, más te vale haber farmeado poder o tener MUCHA suerte, si no, no podrás llegar a la tan querida corona. El objetivo del juego es claro, pero hasta que llegas a esa corona puede pasar mucho rato y vivir muchas aventuras. 

Podrás jugar online, o offline contra la máquina. Actualmente solo he probado offline y me parece un juego perfecto. Raro de encontrar cosas así en Pc, por eso lo recomiendo tanto.

El único punto malo pero a la vez positivo, son las DLC´s-

***Negativo***
Hay muchas DLC´s, y cada una tiene un precio con rebaja de unos 3€, también se venden personajes individuales por 1€ o 2€. 

***Positivo***
Las DLC´s añaden mucho contenido, ya que algunas, como ""The Dragon"" añaden, zonas nuevas al tablero, más de 300 cartas nuevas(enemigos, conjuros, eventos, seguidores...), 6 heroes nuevos, finales distintos... En definitiva añade una cantidad de contenido nuevo, que poco a poco consigue construir un juego increíblemente amplio y divertido (y eso que la versión normal ya es genial). The Woodland, es otra DLC que añade zonas de tablero nuevas, personajes, cartas...

EN DEFINITIVA
Un juego 100% recomendado, aún teniendo muchas DLC´s, que ni de lejos es obligatorio adquirir, es genial. Ademas, en los tiempos que vivimos que te cobran por una skin 4€ (por ejemplo), pagar 3€ o 6€ por DLC´s que añaden partes de tablero nuevo, héroes nuevos, muchísimas cartas nuevas, finales distintos... Creo que son precios ridículos, sinceramente. Te animo a probar este juego, que por menos de 3€ te va a dar muchas horas de diversión, solo o en compañía de tus amigos.

I've decided to only buy 3rd party dlc mainly steam trains because they seem to have more quality to them.

I ONLY RECOMMEND BUYING THE GAME AND DLC WHEN ON SALE!

The prices are way too high. I buy DCS planes for around the same price as some of the dlc trains, and DCS plane quality is HUGELY better so asking the same price for one of these trains is a joke.

PROS:
-Lots of trains and routes to chose from if you're willing to pay

-Although graphics are dated, can look nice especially rain effects on windows

-Some train dlcs are very nice and well done, if you're on a limited budget make sure to buy the 3rd party trains first

-Interface is nicely designed

-Includes an editor for making your own routes

MIXED:
-The ""simulation"" is fairly tame compared to World of subways; Often not all buttons work in trains and many small features missing that make a game a true simulator

-Amount of dlc would make EA proud

CONS:
-Questionable performance and optimization; I originally refunded this because of how bad my fps was on a powerful computer, I still can't play on full graphics

-The dlc seems to be quantity over quality type production

-Very high price dlcs considering their quality and their content

-Apparently many dlcs have low support and have bugs or problems that have never been fixed

-Game uses an old game engine, game has been renamed to ""2016"" to make it seem like the newest version

-Graphics are dated in many places

You found it. Escape From Tarkov isn't just a normal game it's a simulator that tries to bring something similar to a real life shooting mission to the players. It's still in Beta, sure, but it already has so much content. Some people who purchased this game started crying and raging because they where killed instantly at the beginning of the match after 5 minutes or less. ""Invisible people killed me"" those are just other players that probably where far away shooting with a sniper. A lot of people come and are like ""Oh this game looks like call of duty"" this is where they are wrong. You may be a pro in call of duty but in tarkov you are going to get killed easily. 
The game is really interesting, there are many cool stuff like:

-Drinking and Eating: Yeah this is important because after some time your character is gonna get dehydrated or hungry which makes the whole surviving harder. There are cool animations when the player eats or drinks, bringing more realism to the game.

-Armor: This is a really important factor during the gameplay, in fact if you get into a raid with bad armor or without you have a higher chance of getting killed. Helmets help a lot too but it always depends on what gun was used against you and which kind of bullet. So Based on that a face shiled, for example, could save your life or not.

-Bullets: There are so many bullets in this game than in all the others mixed together and there is an important reason. Basic ammo are usually for beginners or for those who don't want to spend much ingame currency on them. The basic ones sure don't do much damage and a well geared enemy may survive many shots before dying but they are effective versus bots some times. If you instead want to easily kill someone tho you may use penetrating bullets which are the ebst choice for players that want to kill easier their enemies.

-Grenades, Flashbangs and smokes:
Nice and cool animation, the flashbang works properly, some times blinding softly, you can see a flash spot but also the surroundings, and other times hardly, you see the flash spot and nothing else around. The smokes are realisticly looking but there is a - the particles of smoke get through textures smoking parts of a building for example a room close to another where there should not be any smoke. About normal grenades, what to say, they are deadly.

These are some of the many good points of the game. Considering this game is still in Beta and it's not the final product it deserves a 100 vote.",100

Spoiler werden natürlich nicht enthalten sein.

Die Story die mit Shadowkeep hinzukam ist wie immer seit D1 Linear und man kann sich eigtl danken was passieren wird was Mission Designe angeht da gibt also nicht viel neues.

Lore ist wiedermal sehr spannend man bekommt natürlich mehr Infos bzgl [Redacted] aber es gibt auch mehr Infos bzgl Eris, ihrem Trupp und auch was auf dem Mond eigtl vorgeht, wie immer wunderbar sowas zuerfahren auch wenn etwas zu kurz.

Hütersprache auch diesesmal reden wir seeehr wenig, zwar etwas mehr als in Forsaken jedoch leider zu kurz, wir sind also sehr schnell wieder Sprachlose ""Deppen"" 

Vex Invasion ist abwechslungsreich, macht spaß und ist für mein Teil echt nen guter Zeitvertreib zum spaß haben

Albtraumjagd sind runtergebrochen leichte Nightfalls mit Nostalgieschub, geben Essenzen aber das wars leider auch komplett, Idee gut, umsetzung naja... 

Content/Designe wieder sehr viel Reskins (Wurden jedoch von Anfang an angekündigt das vieles wiederverwertet wird) Content wird auch erst mehr sobald die Season richtung ende geht also kann man dazu nicht all zuviel sagen

Mehr gibts auch so nicht zusagen.

Info : Neue Spieler können die Vanila Story etc von Amanda holliday im Hanger holen.

Aber nicht so schlimm wie der letzte Teil. Das beste am Spiel ist wohl die Lizens der Nfl. Es hat als einziges Spiel die echten Teams. Das Gameplay ist langsamer und etwas(!) angenehmer als im Vorgänger. Heißt das, dass es gut ist? NEIN! Es spielt sich schrecklich. Die Animationen sind furchtbar, was nicht gut ist, da das ganze Gameplay aus Animationen und keiner echten Physik besteht. Durch diese Animationen-Abhänigigkeit folgen Bugs, und Glitches. Um mehr zu sehen einfach mal bei Youtube: ""Sloppy Madden"" oder "" Madden Bugs"" eingeben und man findet sehr viele Videos. Außerdem ist die Grafik nicht mehr Zeitgemäß. Man schaue auf Madden 17 und man sähe keinen Unterschied. Spieler sind hässlich, Fans nicht mal erkennbar, und das liegt nicht an meinem PC und den Grafikeinstellungen. Andere EA Spiele wie Fifa, Battlefield oder sogar ein Need for Speed haben deutlich schönere Grafik. Kommen wir zu den Spielmodi. Es gibt einen Karriere, bzw. Franchise Modus, welcher seit mindestens 3 Jahren der selbe ist. Es gibt einen ""Schnelles-Spiel"" Modus, wo man halt ein Football-Spiel spielt, was bei dem Kaputten Gameplay sich aber garnicht wie Football anfühlt. Es gibt die Große Neuerung, den Face of the Franchise Modus, welcher eine KATASTROPHE ist. Die Story ist langweilig, die Spiele auch und nach gut 1 Stunde ist es auch schon vorbei und man hat eine ganz normale Spieler Karriere. Dann gibt es noch Ultimate Team. Wer neu bei EA-Sport Spielen ist, kann sich über Ultimate Team woanders informieren. Glaub mir, es ist schlecht. Kurzgefasst, entweder bezahlst du für Packs oder du musst 10 Stunden lang immer wieder Spiele spielen gegen 99 ovr Teams. Die neuen X-FACTORS sind komplett OP und reichen nicht als Verkaufsargument aus. Ein weiterer Punkt für Madden ist der Soundtrack, welcher verdammt geil ist, meiner Meinung nach. Aber ich würde die Finger von dem Spiel, bzw. allen EA-SPORTS Games lassen. Vorallem wenn bald das neue Madden rauskommt. Vllt. ist dieses dann reduziert und man denkt sich für nen guten Preis könnte man sich es holen. NEIN, spar dein Geld und mach was sinnvolles damit aber kauf dir NICHT MADDEN 20!!!",20

It has had a rough time with early access and the launch, but if you are an avid battle royale fan you might want to keep your eye on this one. 

Another Battle Royale game? *Yawn*
I know most people aren’t really keen on trying out another battle royale game as the genre is getting really saturated right now with new releases still being churned out. But Fear the Wolves has put its own unique twist on the genre in numerous small ways. Each one making sure the game offers a slightly different experience from other titles in the genre but at the same time ensuring the game stays true to any standard battle royale game.

To start off, the game takes place in a futuristic Chernobyl. Instead of a random circle that does damage to player’s outside, parts of the map get marked as ‘radiated’. This doesn’t happen in a circular manner but in patches from the outside working to random point on the map. If you are in this area not only do you take damage but it also reduces your max hp as well. But don’t worry as there are a few items such as anti-radiation pills that can revert these negative debuffs. The game also has several items that let you survive in the radiation zone for a while such as hazmat suits and oxygen tanks.

Okay, but why Fear the ‘Wolves’
Now, the reason behind the name of the game. Have you played any battle royale game, spawned in a quite location. Sneak your way to the final circle and die to someone you didn’t see? It makes you feel like you wasted the past 20-30 minutes of your life and that you didn’t really do anything in the game. Well this game has found a way to counter that in a very intuitive manner. This game introduces these mutant wolves. They are spread across the map. They can do a lot of damage and need to be dealt with swiftly. It may require an entire magazine at times just to save your life. It introduces it’s own element to the game. As it requires numerous resources, you may want to be in an area where there are more players. This will make sure you are less likely to run into a pack of wolves plus it’s fewer bullets to kill another player than a wolf.

This sounds perfect, what’s the catch?
While this game is unique in a largely un-innovative genre this game severely lacks players. You may be forced to go to a server with worse ping just to find a full game. Some times you may not be able to find a game at all because too few players. But if you are from a region where there are players or in a timezone where you are able to play when most others are then this isn’t as bad of an issue.

Final Verdict:
While this is a good game at its core, I can’t recommend it at full price because of the small playerbase. However, if you are a fan of battle royale games and want a taste of something slightly different it’s worth picking up. To others, I would still encourage picking up this game on a sale.",70

If you just came from work and only want to relax, get it. I guess then it's a ""good"" game for you.

Literally nothing - not a single positive point comes in my mind for Battlefield V.
I am not going to explain why the game is one of the worst games ever developed & if you don't get why, please don't talk.
The actual best state of the game was after the release (Edited this review since then).

If you like this game; following things might be the reason:
- You are a casual & just want to play a game (that's totally okay btw)
- You were promoted/paid by EA/DICE to vote their game up (if so, no words for you)
- You started playing the BF franchise with Battlefield V and you have no idea what a good Battlefield is

Friendly reminder if you care about that point - Battlefield V reveal:
""There won't be any microtransactions! Everything can be unlocked trough just playing the game."" 
Well, take a look now ;)

Just don't .. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, NOR YOUR TIME. Why?
Worse than ever before. Just listing a few negative points:
- Lack of optimization 
- Bugs & glitches
- Complete mess called ""movement""
- Input delay
- Week for week new unplayable playlists
- no RSP with plugins
- In-game / weapon & vehicle balance 
- Countless cheater 
- Skill trees instead of weapon attachments 
- Level & unlock system
- In-game UI
- Random recoil of guns
- Gunplay in general
+ 5 points down below.
... the list could go on.

@DICE SW / EA - Keep doing what you do: Ignore constructive feedback and you ruin your studio(s) even more then you already do now.

Or instead: Shut down this garbage piece of sh*t and don't ever touch Battlefield again, since you love to ruin great games and or genres anyway.

@DICE LA - Fix this game, PLEASE.

Dropped score from 30 to 10. Would even go lower than 0 if possible.

Atelier Sophie... il s'agit ici de mon tout premier Atelier pour être honnête, n'ayant jamais été au courant des anciens (Atelier Sophie étant le 17ème jeu de la série !) et aussi car à l'époque je ne savais pas parler et comprendre l'anglais comme aujourd'hui.

Oui vous l'aurez deviné et de toutes façons vous l'avez peut-être vu sur la fiche, mais Atelier Sophie comme tout les autres jeux ne sont qu'en anglais grand maximum, les tout premiers étant traduits que par des patchs faits par les fans.

Il faut savoir que les jeux Atelier sont en général composés de sagas de 3 volets, par exemple Atelier Sophie, Firis ainsi que Lydie & Suelle sont de la saga Mysterious, et par exemple Atelier Rorona, Meruru et Totori qui sont récemment ressortis pour une édition Steam sont de la saga Arland.
Note importante : L'histoire des saga ne se suivent pas directement, faire Atelier Firis avant Sophie ne sera pas handicapant par exemple, cependant il se peut que certains personnages réapparaissent et qu'ils fassent quelques références aux jeux de la saga, du coup techniquement c'est peut-être mieux quand même de les faire dans l'ordre pour tout comprendre.

Mais dis-moi Jamy, pourquoi tu nous dis de jouer à ce jeu si on aime les J-RPG ?
Eh bien tout simplement car ces jeux-là sortent un peu du J-RPG ordinaire, il s'agit même carrément d'une niche à l'intérieur d'une niche qu'est le J-RPG c'est peu dire.

Qu'est-ce qui fait de ce jeu, un bon jeu ?

L'histoire, bien qu'elle doit reprendre les bases sur tout les jeux Atelier, change du J-RPG traditionnel, pas de ""héros élu"" ou autres, vous débutez, vous êtes une petite alchimiste du nom de Sophie ultra nulle en alchimie, et vous découvrez un livre... qui parle, oui qui parle. Ce livre connaît vachement bien le monde de l'alchimie et il se trouve que celui-ci a perdu la mémoire, Sophie décide alors de s'améliorer en alchimie grâce à Plachta - le livre - et d'essayer de retrouver sa mémoire, vous rencontrerez de nombreux personnages hauts en couleurs et découvrirez au fur et à mesure que finalement ce n'est pas toujours rose en fin de compte.

L'alchimie, je ne connais pas vraiment les jeux Atelier et je compte vraiment rattraper mon retard, je pense m'acheter Firis ainsi que Lydie & Suelle et pourquoi pas les jeux de la saga Arland vu que le prochain sort cette année sur cette même saga. (Première fois qu'un quatrième volet d'une saga sort par ailleurs)
L'alchimie est vraiment très cool dans le jeu, on ne s'ennuie pas à le faire, on aime bien chercher à avoir de meilleurs effets sur les objets qu'on confectionne etc... Si vous avez un peu de mal une petite recherche sur Google et vous trouvez votre bonheur, j'ai un peu fait ça au début et maintenant je me démerde comme un grand.

Les personnages, ils sont fabuleux, tous autant qu'ils sont, on peut en aimer un moins que les autres, mais ils sont géniaux, leur design, leur caractère etc... tout est hyper détaillé, et vous retrouverez dans le jeu des dizaines et des dizaines de petites quêtes secondaires ou de dialogues avec les différents personnages, quand vous avez fini de faire quelques recettes ou que vous rentrez de cueillette, pensez à faire le tour des personnages pour voir si des dialogues spéciaux se lancent, c'est vraiment sympa.

Et les points négatifs...

Oui il y en a quelques-uns quand même, voire plus, mais comme j'aime le jeu je ne les vois peut-être pas directement.
En début de jeu, vous êtes vraiment une m**de en combat et parfois en allant dans un lieu pour faire votre cueillette, vous tombez sur des mobs surpuissants sur le chemin que vous ne pouvez pas éviter car vous avez une évasion de m***de et vous crevez instantanément, je dois vous avouer que ça m'avait un peu mis la rage.
Ou alors comme ça m'est arrivé hier, vous sortez d'une zone car vous voulez rentrer chez vous, et vous apparaissez dans une autre zone sauf que pas de bol, le mob se trouve sur l'endroit où vous apparaissez, donc le combat pop automatiquement sans que vous puissiez essayer de l'esquiver, vous vous faites déglinguer sans pouvoir rien faire et vous perdez 80% de votre cueillette, et en général ce que vous réussissez à garder c'est pas ce qu'il vous faut.
La difficulté est un peu élevée et l'argent ne vous tombe pas dessus sauf vers un endroit spécifique où vous pouvez avoir pas mal d'argent, l'expérience malheureusement il vous faudra farm des monstres assez puissants en espérant ne pas mourir.

Ce sont les seuls points négatifs que j'ai retenus personnellement.

En bref...

Atelier Sophie est un excellent jeu tout comme je l'imagine probablement pour tout les autres jeux de la série, cependant une histoire ou certains mécanismes propres à ces jeux peuvent plus vous séduire que d'autres, donc ne vous arrêtez pas au premier jeu et essayez-en au moins un deuxième ;)",100

I know that American Nightmare isn’t a main game or a sequel itself, but even the two DLCs were more interesting than this. Well, maybe “interesting” is not the right word… But Alan Wake is supposed to be a thriller/horror combo, and I just didn’t feel any of those with American Nightmare. It was still fun to play, but I just didn’t feel the same “This is so scary, I want to put it down to calm my soul” vibe I felt with the previous game. The Taken were very easy to kill (I think I only died like 3 times in the game, whereas in Alan Wake I died more times than I can count, even in the easiest mode), and the quests themselves were too easy as well… I’m definitely going to play the game again, because I have a few more achievement points to get, plus, as I said, it is a fun game—just not as powerful as the first installment.",70

You earn coins by playing several mini-games which are very exciting. In those games, you meet Disney friends. Very funny but easy.
Speaking of friends. You can do the game in co-op when another controller or keyboard is on your computer. Didn't try it yet.
Graphics and Details are heavy. So much to travel into and always look what is hidden. 
Playing this game you get more special abilities and wonderful tools to earn a lot of extra coins. 
You can ride classic attractions and walk into 7 or 8 areas of Disneyland. The only stupid thing is that if you want all achievements you have to take too many photos, must collect tiny little lamps, hidden mickey mouses and for me, I don't like that, its too much. Collect 100 here, find 50 there and so on. 
Thump up for that game.",100

Mentre x-blades era carino, soprattutto per gli anni che ha. Questo, il seguito, è ridicolo.

Headshot che non vengono calcolati a iosa. Ne servono 7 per ammazzare un mob qualunque. Bodyshot che non fanno danni, non ho osato manco contare i colpi per un mob.

Hasn't disappointed me in the first few chapters, there are some good suspenseful ""hollywood"" bits and pieces / decent atmospherics. I am also enjoying the Devs vision of such an underworld environment, it's dark / macabre but not ridiculous. The lighting effects are good, the ambiance is also pretty cool and goes well with the suspenseful feeling of the environment. In Martyr mode you certainly feel very very fragile and vulnerable. No charging around with insane powers / weapons and the like so far, ""Hell"" is very much more powerful than you in this game and you have to learn how to get around it. I particularly enjoy the sidestepping and gap squeezing you have to do, especially when you're being chased by a demon, it's pretty exciting and a good use of the map. I have seen such gaps, nooks and the like in other FP games, it's great to be able to use them.

The game is not perfect, I think the NPCs could look better & the voice acting could also have been a little better (regarding NPCs). Also the subtitles (if you have them on) don't always match with the voice which is a quality issue that should have been picked up. 

Overall though, for the first few hours of play. I am glad I waited, £18 well spent and for this sort of price you might as well see what you think. it's hardly the most expensive title of the year and as such, it's worth a purchase. ",90

Not only the controls feel much better, the new gadgets like the (Bavarium powered) wingsuit and the retracting tethers alone sell it for me. Out of ammo? Just pull a helicopter into a gas tank and watch it explode. The world design is just amazingly done and beautiful. It is smaller than Panau from Just Cause 2, but also better filled with interesting landmarks and a better variety of things to blow up. Yes the story and characters are as cheesy as they can get. But do you really expect some serious characters with a rich and interesting past to tell you about? This game is just like it's predecessors a playable action movie with a lot of freedom where you can play with your creativity.

But there is a few big downside which are pretty much unnecessary and could've been avoided in making this game. 

downside:+ a few negative points under this text
performance
The performance is sometimes and without tweaking a catastrophe. My PC is high-end and so way over the recommended requirements (i7 7700k, 16GB ram, GTX1070, game installed on SSD) and the FPS sometimes just tank down to ~40 FPS. But that luckily rarely happened in my hours of play time. A simple restart of the game also fixed that for me. 

There is a very helpful guide in the steam guides posted that helps fixing the performance completely. Aside from the framedrops that I mentioned earlier the game ran always at over 60 FPS with all settings on maximum.

Repetetive 
The whole game feels this way, from the stories to the bases to .. everything. They did well giving another look to each base for sure but it does not feel as rewarding as it was in Just Cause 2. 

All in all I would still recommend this game to everyone who likes a good action open world sandbox, even though the setup is annoying. But the fun you will get out of this game is worth taking the 10 minutes to configure it. As long as you don't tab out of the game of course. :p

Peut-être est-ce a cause d'un lancement trop hâtif, mais un bug récurrent est présent. Vous voulez voir vos replays ? Ben faudra attendre un patch correctif, car beaucoup de personnes ont apparemment le même problème qu'il n'ont pas accès à leurs replays. Ca la fout mal pour ceux qui veulent faires des vidéos youtube de leurs meilleurs swings. Malgré ca, ce jeu est un petit bijou. Les mauvaises langues sur Steam parlent d'une copie conforme de PGA 2019. Je ne pense pas que ce soit le cas. Un bon paquet de licences, des marques connues dans le monde du Golf professionnel et de vrais parcours de golf font oublier petit à petit la saga PGA Tour d'EA Sports. Fautes de licences vous ne verrez pas Tigerwoods ou McIlroy qui sont apparemment encore lié à Electronic Arts. Espérons les revoir très prochainement dans le prochain opus....",80

En lo referente a la historia, desde luego es un JRPG clásico, de los que utilizaban la trama como una excusa para justificar el juego en si. En este caso, la historia es un trámite para ambientar la aventura con su entretenido sistema de combate y el bonito apartado visual que ofrece el juego. No se toma muy en serio a si misma, y cuenta con elementos muy caricaturizados. No esperes giros argumentales, lógica o coherencia en demasía. Aun así, mantiene cierto encanto de fantasía.

En contraparte, la repetición de modelos ya en las primeras horas es muy obvia. Quita un poco de inmersión en una historia que empieza con tirones de guión y escenas representadas con poco acierto.

Si te gusta juego de tronos el juego es aceptable, y recalco el aceptable porque no es un rts al uso, de un modo simple busca imitar las acciones de la saga, véase la vía militar, la comercial, la traición y la diplomática. Existe un mapa con ciudades principales y las secundarias, las primeras buscan anexionar a las segundas y controlar el mapa para ganar la partida.

Cuentas con varias unidades, comerciantes para traer oro, granjeros para generar oro, diplomacias que debes enviar a las ciudades para aliarte con ellos, pero cuidado porque cuando los muevas el enemigo puede minar tu alianza o enviar a alguien para el subterfugio, por otro lado las princesas sirven para afianzar esas alianzas de forma más solidas. Cada unidad hay que mantenerla, así que usar a tus militares para conquistar puede ser una opción, pero es mejor atacar a las caravanas y debilitar al enemigo. Como digo es simple, se basa en llevar tu peón a un lado y mientras este alli todo estará en orden.

Por otro lado el ámbito militar no tiene mucha miga, pues vuelve a ser simple, hay unos pocos tipos de unidades, cada uno te consume recursos y cada unidad tiene su counter y hay que tener cuidado con mantener tus caravanas y granjeros.

En definitiva es un 65, es un juego que sin pretensiones trata de trasladar la experiencia juego de tronos a un rts, pero al mismo tiempo con una sencillez tal que pueda ser accesible a todo el mundo, en resumen termina por ser un juego repetitivo después de un par de partidas, no tiene mucha miga

Ahora bien, la campaña es lo gordo, es un juego mediocre (lo cual no es malo, es un juego del montón) que cuenta con una buena historia, la campaña se divide en varios ""libros"" y cada uno con sus respectivos capitulos y podremos explorar la historia de Poniente, desde los tiempos de Nymeria y la unificación de Dorne, pasando por la llegada de Aegon el Conquistador o la Rebelión de Robert, y esta parte si que cuenta con un buen aliciente, con situaciones variadas y con una historia maravillosa que explorar.

En definitiva es un juego aceptable, fiel a la licencia que explota pero denostado por la comunidad porque no es lo que ellos querian ni deja de ser un juego muy complejo, el modo libre apenas tiene interes pero si te gusta Canción de Hielo y Fuego jugaras a la campaña con ganas y esa es la parte que si merece la pena, pero siempre sabiendo que no es AoE.",60

Ici, on sort clairement des sentiers battus par les jeux Star Wars sortis jusque là pour, une aventure totalement neuve et originale. Les personnages sont attachants et ont leurs enjeux personnels mais un but commun: se débarrasser de la Fédération du commerce.

Ma nostalgie me dicte inlassablement de noter le jeu à 100 mais la réalité des faits m'oblige à noter à 90 car le jeu n'est pas parfait (du à son âge malheureusement). Le son est assez compliqué à gérer, quelques petits bugs peuvent faire leur apparition, la maniabilité parfois compliquée à gérer, la difficulté (que je recommande de laisser en facile) assez stupide car liée au résultat des impacts (un tir reçu fait dévier très fortement votre vaisseau, sur certaines missions, il est juste impossible de réussir certains défis, voire même votre mission car vous ne pouvez juste pas contrôler votre vaisseau.

Comme dit précédemment, vous allez jongler entre nos 3 personnages qui ont chacun leur propre vaisseau avec ses capacités spéciales et allez devoir affronter toute sorte de vaisseaux ennemis, autant classiques comme les chasseurs droïdes et les chars mais également des vaisseaux inédits dans la saga. On notera tout de même que le vaisseau de Nym aurait mérité une puissance de feu un peu plus élevée mais on fera avec.

On va déjà commencer par les graphismes du jeu qui sont complètement à gerber pour certains qui aime les tous nouveaux jeux mais si vous kiffer l'univers de One Piece, les personnages et défoncer des milliers de mec de la Marine, de loups, de lapins des neiges géants ou même les phoques kung-fu de Alabasta alors foncez ! Le jeu est une remasterisation de celui sur console et ne présente par d'avantage particulier il est tout simplement un classique des One Piece avec de nouveaux personnages comme ""Redfield"" ou ""Pato"" et d'autres qui vous demanderont de construire des bâtiments ou de faire des quêtes... On peut aussi faire de la pêche ou attraper des insectes pour par exemple : construire un musée, les utiliser pour améliorer ses armes etc... Un des grands avantages du jeu c'est que l'on retrouve les grands personnages classique comme Barbe Blanche, le dieu Ener, Ace, Akainu ce sale moche et d'autres... Nos personnages de l'équipe du chapeau de paille peuvent évoluer en montant des niveaux et on peut apprendre des techniques différentes sur chaque personnage. Attention à ce qui on une petite configuration car le jeu à tendance à crash sans raison ou simplement en faisant un ALT+TAB et vous n'avez pas sauvegardé donc, c'est embêtant mais moi qui ai une bonne configuration j'ai crash qu'une seule fois... Au niveau des boss, ils sont très facile à combattre et vous n'avez pas tellement besoin de réfléchir à ces mouvements pour trouver ses points faibles, vous avez juste à le mitrailler à coup de gum gum gatalinga ""gum gum rafale"" sinon on peut aussi utiliser la merveilleuse technique de Sanji ""POELE A FRIRE, SPECTRO !"" Donc pour le prix du jeu, je pense qu'il ne le vaut absolument pas, peut-être qu'il présente beaucoup de positif mais trop de négatif pour le prix de 40E... Je ne le conseille pas pour les gens à qui ça n'intéresse pas trop à One Piece et ceux qui n'aime pas les graphismes très bas. Pour ce qui finiront le jeu plus, il y a des quêtes disponible à la tavernes et même ENORMEMENT DE QUÊTES. Sur ce, je pense que j'ai tout dis, c'est mon premier commentaire sur Instant Gaming donc voilà je pense qu'il est pas mal ^^",70

Dagegen sind die verschiedenen Spielwelten gut gemacht, abwechslungsreich. Insgesamt eine schöne Mischung aus Kämpfen und Plattform Anteilen.

Le plus grand changement est que DW2 est un jeu d'exploration 3D plutôt qu'un jeu de pointer-cliquer. Le joueur a le contrôle total sur le protagoniste Howard Loreid. Il peut librement marcher, courir, sauter, s'accroupir et manipuler certains objets mobiles. Tout cela sonne bien et dandy, mais il est évident assez tôt dans le jeu à quel point ces changements ajoutent peu à l'expérience. Howard peut explorer des emplacements librement, mais les emplacements eux-mêmes semblent souvent aussi petits ou plus petits que les zones du premier jeu, vous seul pouvez interagir avec eux maintenant. Vous traitez principalement dans des espaces fermés et des pièces isolées. Le village où vous arrivez au début du jeu n'est guère plus qu'une petite place de ville avec peu d'endroits saisissables, tous assez courts et insignifiants. Il y a des zones plus grandes auxquelles vous aurez accès plus tard, mais vous ne pouvez pas les explorer complètement, ou il est monotone et inutile de le faire. Cela n'est pas aidé par le fait que la vitesse de «course» de l'Howard ressemble à la marche, sa vitesse de marche ressemble à celle de ramper, et si vous avez exécuté la bascule, elle s'arrête chaque fois que vous entrez dans une zone chargée séparément. Je ne suis pas puriste du point and click, j'ai probablement joué à moins de 10 jeux du genre, mais la décision de DW2 d'aller en 3D semble totalement inutile et préjudiciable. Je ne sais pas si c'était une tentative d'atteindre un public plus large, ou peut-être de réaliser une plus grande immersion. Si c'était ce dernier, alors c'était un échec absolu parce que… J'ai probablement joué à moins de 10 jeux du genre, mais la décision de DW2 de passer à la 3D semble totalement inutile et préjudiciable.

Le saut est un désordre buggy. Je pensais que j'étais juste incroyablement malchanceux quand je suis tombé par terre au bout de 30 minutes dans le jeu, mais ensuite ça a continué à se reproduire encore et encore. Étape 1: commencez à marcher dans n'importe quel mur / porte / obstacle. Étape 2: sauter. Étape 3: Continuez à maintenir le bouton de marche enfoncé. Répétez plusieurs fois si nécessaire. Félicitations, vous pouvez désormais couper environ 95% du jeu. Cette coupure se termine presque exclusivement par une chute de la carte dans l'oubli. Il y a quelques cas où il peut vous donner accès à des salles avant que vous ne soyez censé y accéder, mais cela ne fournit jamais aucun avantage. Même si nous mettons de côté à quel point le saut est complètement cassé, je ne pense pas que vous soyez réellement requissauter du tout dans le jeu? Il y a quelques points où il pourrait être plus pratique de le faire plutôt que de déplacer certains meubles, mais dans l'ensemble, le saut est totalement buggé et superflu. S'accroupir est légèrement moins bogué et légèrement plus utile, mais pas de beaucoup. Vous pouvez vous faufiler à travers certains murs en y pénétrant en vous accroupissant, mais ce n'est pas aussi omniprésent qu'en sautant. Certains indices / objets ne peuvent être trouvés / examinés qu'en s'accroupissant, ce qui, je suppose, est modérément réaliste, mais s'accroupir pour trouver un indice ne m'a jamais fait dire ""Ouais, cela fait que l'abandon du genre pointer-cliquer en vaut la peine"". La manipulation d'objets est également inutile. Howard doit occasionnellement déplacer quelque chose dans une pièce, mais la plupart du temps, les objets ne servent à rien et ne font que gêner.

Les parties les plus perplexes de DW2 sont pour la plupart intactes. Il y a beaucoup de matériel à lire, mais il y a généralement moins d'indices et de combinaisons de pensées que le premier jeu. Les puzzles sont encore fréquents, mais ils ne m'ont jamais autant intrigué qu'ils l'ont fait dans DW1.

Vous pourriez penser que le jeu plus concentré sur l'exploration vous mettrait en contact avec plus de gens, mais ce n'est pas le cas. Vous pouvez parler à 5 PNJ tout au long du jeu, tous hideux, caoutchouteux, quasi-humains et portant des mains yaoi. Les conversations ne sont rien d'autre qu'une exposition, et lorsque vous avez plusieurs options de dialogue, vous êtes censé les épuiser dans l'ordre où elles sont présentées, sinon il y a de fortes chances qu'elles n'aient pas de sens. Il y a une poignée de PNJ de fond / spectateurs dans la ville, mais ils ne servent qu'à vous faire sentir plus seul. Ils n'ont même pas de réponses de dialogue en conserve. Vous pouvez allumer une lampe de poche et sauter sur un hobo de la gare ferroviaire endormie sans conséquences. La plupart des conversations de DW1 ont eu lieu par téléphone et les interactions humaines étaient rares. Bien que le monde de DW1 se sente isolé,

Viser plus d'immersion a peut-être été tenté avec de bonnes intentions, mais ces intentions ne servent à rien lorsque vous parcourez la carte toutes les 5 minutes, explorez des endroits rares et parlez à des PNJ sans vie.

La critique de l'histoire de DW2 est plus vague, car l'histoire de DW2 estplus vague. L'histoire de DW1 n'était pas exactement claire, mais DW2 est encore plus coupable d'obscurcir la vérité (c'est en supposant qu'il y en a une). Je ne suis pas étranger à la façon dont les trucs Lovecraftian fonctionnent - il serait stupide de s'attendre à ce que chaque détail et mystère soit complètement expliqué. Pourtant, l'histoire de DW2 semble si… insatisfaisante? Une partie du problème est à quel point il se sent déconnecté de DW1. Aucun des emplacements de DW1 n'est revisité, la plupart des références à celui-ci sont juste en passant, et pour dépenser DW1 ""In Pursuit Of Loath Nolder"", Loath Nolder a un rôle remarquablement petit dans le 2ème jeu. Alors que DW1 était un jeu de déduction et d'aller au fond des choses, dans DW2, on a l'impression que vous faites simplement diverses tâches parce qu'on vous le dit. Il y a la menace supposée de personnes qui viennent après vous et autres, mais dans l'ensemble, l'histoire semble sans but. Comme l'indique le titre ""The Dark Lineage"", ce jeu concerne principalement la connexion de Howard à ces complots et complots. Pourtant, Howard se présente comme ayant moins de personnalité que le premier match. Entre les deux matchs, il semble avoir complètement surmonté sa folie potentielle (à part une explosion occasionnelle), ce qui à son tour rend les choses beaucoup moins intéressantes. De même, les séquences cauchemardesques induites par la folie de Howard sont presque entièrement absentes également. Sans raison valable, et seulement pour rendre les choses moins intéressantes. Howard n'a aucune personnalité dans les conversations avec les PNJ; il demande juste ce qu'il a besoin de savoir. Il sort un peu plus de sa coquille dans la 2e moitié du jeu lorsqu'il est confronté directement à son passé, mais finalement ce n'est pas suffisant pour sauver son personnage. ce jeu concerne principalement la connexion de Howard à ces complots et complots.

Le mécontentement avec l'histoire qui ne vient pas de la relation du jeu avec DW1, vient de la conclusion du jeu. Tout ce qui vient après que ressemble fondamentalement à un non séquencement pour le reste du jeu. Oui, je sais que c'est censé être Lovecraftien et bizarre, mais il se présente comme terne, précipité et nébuleux, même en tenant compte des multiples fins. C'est insatisfaisant pour l'histoire de DW1, et ce qui avait été mis en place dans DW2 jusqu'à ce point. Ensuite, il y a des points d'intrigue frustrants et non résolus, comme , ou comment à mi-chemin du jeu ??? Il y a la narration Lovecraftienne, puis la mauvaise narration.

Même si vous avez vraiment apprécié DW1, je vous recommande de rester à l'écart de ce jeu. On ne répondra pas à vos questions et vous repartirez déçu et frustré. La seule chose que je peux dire de qualité vraiment égale entre les deux jeux, ce sont leurs excellentes bandes sonores. Les PNJ cireux du jeu et la compréhension lâche des murs peuvent se révéler involontairement Lovecraftian, mais dans l'ensemble, ce jeu est une chose qui ne devrait pas l'être..",50

Un bijou rare même unique - mais attention il a mal vieilli! Il pourrait vous repousser même. Cependant il reste l'un des meilleurs jeu du genre... à ce jour!

Attention aussi : ceux qui n'aiment pas les héros surdéveloppés vous pouvez vous arrêter là. Ce jeu ne pourra être fait pour vous. Ceux qui n'aiment pas le tour par tour également ^^. Enfin ceux qui s'attendent à de la gestion de ressources resterez sur votre faim ou presque.

Quel intérêt alors? Il s'agit d'un jeu de stratégie et votre défi sur une map constistera à financer des armées, utiliser vos héros pour vous agrandir sans vous mettre en péril et c'est la que le jeu est bien ficelé. Vos héros feront une bonne partie du travail et en début de partie c en tout cas fort apprécié.

Vous trouverez de multiples races qui se spécifient au fur et à mesure que vous montez la ville de level, Les races ne sont pas forcément équilibrées mais peu importe : vous pouvez en diriger plusieurs en profiter des avantages qu'elles profitent. A vous de décider.
La campagne peut etre considérée comme simpliste mais par contre vous allez vous arracher les cheveux sur chaque scénario ^^. Attention il s'agit d'un jeu multi ending aussi vous aurez donc quelques choix à faire ^^. La musique est entraînante bien sur.

Quelques points faibles bien entendu mais liés surtout à l'époque à laquelle le jeu est sorti : écoles de magie, gestion des combats peu attrayante (vous pouvez jouer en auto aussi), décors en 3D isométrique donc très mal vieilli.

Côté multi joueur le jeu est en simultané et rend le tour par tour moins long. J'ai surtout apprécié le mode campagne du jeu.

The Character level system is intuitive and fun since you have to earn souls by killing enemies and then sell them to Vulgrim to upgrade your level giving you a skill point you can spend freely on the 3 Attributes health, Strength and Magic, all enhancing the character in the long run.
The story is great and builds on the story of Darksiders 1 and 2.

This is definately one of my favourite games of all time.When the game launched it was really one of a kind.The characters,the mechanics of the game,the atmosphere and the graphics.
Everything is spectacular.
The game as an idea is totally awesome.I mean,who wouldn't want to control real-time legendary fights between ancient warriors.
For Honor offers many characters for you to choose what suits your playstyle the most.
It's a really fun game to play with your friends when you're way better than them since it feels awesome to hear them cry when you stab them in the foot with your Gladiator!
The game is still alive after all these years..Its community is much smaller now than before but there are still people that are enjoying themselves playing it.
Regular updates are a thing.There is always new content coming up.By saying new content i mean new characters to play cause as far as the events and gamemodes are concerned,your options are really limited.
On the other side of the spectrum though,the game is owned by Ubisoft and this tells us a lot.
It's a great game idea as i said before but the balance between the game characters is ridiculous.Some characters are way op and some others are just dogshit if you can't actually handle them like a pro.
In conclusion,For Honor is an awesome game to play and have fun,but it's also a game that would easily make you throw your keyboard at a wall and make you atheist.I would recommend you to buy it only because it offers a unique experience that no other game of its genre can actually offer you right now.
Enjoy the game!

Dans le scénario : rien de bien fou. Kirby doit encore une fois sauver DreamLand. Wow, quelle imagination ! J'aurai jamais trouvé ça tout seul. Cette fois, en revanche, il est accompagné ! Incroyable n'est-il pas ? Pour se faire, vous devez juste jeter un coeur sur un ennemi et Bingo, c'est désormais votre ami ! (Si c'était aussi simple en vrai...). Pendant son périple, Kirby pourra même compter sur les ""amis de rêves"", à savoir des personnages importants de la série (comme le Roi Dadidou ou Meta Knight, les deux personnages les plus connus avec Kirby), ou de personnages clés dans de précédents opus. Un bon moyen de rappeler les vieux jeux au plus nostalgiques et de les faire découvrir aux plus jeunes. 

Au niveau du gameplay de ce jeu : C'est du Kirby. De la plateforme assez simple et sympathique, même si certains niveaux sont meilleurs que d'autres. Très simple à prendre en main, il est une valeur sûre pour les enfants, habitués au plateforme 2D avec la petite boule rose. Car, hormis sur Nintendo 64 avec Kirby 64 : The Crystal Shards, Tout les opus Kirby se sont déroulés dans des univers en 2 Dimensions. Un univers très coloré et chatoyant avec un personnage principal très mignon, le succès auprès des enfants est assuré.

Cependant, son côté style plateforme pour les enfants relève donc le défaut n°1 du jeu : Contrairement aux autres jeux Kirby, certes simples mais pas non plus réalisables les yeux fermés, celui-ci est HYPER simple ! Et même trop malheureusement. Avoir plus de 100 vies pour combattre le boss final ??? C'est possible ici ! Même si il existe des modes spéciaux qui sont plus difficiles, comme le mode ""The Ultimate Choice"", avec un boss rush assez hardcore dans son niveau le plus difficile, et bien ce Kirby ne nous offre pas beaucoup de challenge, et c'est dommageable, même si ce n'est pas son but initial. Et après tout, avec le recul, cette difficulté très basse est compréhensible : Le but ici est de satisfaire les enfants, pas les speedrunners ou les tryharders. 

Quant à la durée de vie : Elle reste acceptable, même si sa facilité le rend assez rapide à terminer : Parfois, une bonne après-midi peut suffire à le finir entièrement. Les modes bonus offrent une extension de la durée de vie, et le 100% n'est pas assuré aussi rapidement, car compléter tous les tableaux prend parfois du temps. 

Un bon 8/10 pour ce Kirby ? Oui, largement. Car même si le titre est vraiment trop simple, il nous offre encore une fois un univers très chatoyant, agréable et lumineux, dans lequel on se prend d'affection et qu'on espère, évidemment, revoir un jour.",80

Tout d’abord l’histoire du jeu est riche, mais vous pourrez tout de même commencer le jeu sans faire les anciens qui ont bien vieilli mais sont toujours aussi jouissif à jouer. Vous êtes donc une barde, que vous pourrez changer plus tard par votre propre création si vous le souhaitez, et vous êtes, comme dans tout les autres TBT, l’héroïne un peu désinvolte et serez accompagné de compagnon.

Les graphismes sous le moteur Unreal Engine 4 sont plaisant et les donjons sont très beau à regarder, en comparant à d’autres jeux AAA ont perd le points mais je fais une comparaison sur les précédents TBT. 
Et la vue à la première personne permet l’immersion qu’on n’avait pas avant.

Donc, pendant votre quête vous aurez des combats à mener contre des adversaires plus ou moins puissant. Pour lancer les combats se sera soit en prenant l’adversaire de front en premier et dans ce cas là vous commencerez en premier, soit l’adversaire vous aura vu avant et vous serez le deuxième à attaquer.
Le systeme de combat est en tour par tour sur une grille de 4x4 donc 8 carrés de placements pour se déplacer, s’eloigner, s’approcher, esquiver l’ennemi. Vous êtes limité à quelques actions par tour donc choisissez bien et faites une stratégie en fonction de vos compagnons, les sorts ne consomme pas de points d’actions mais des points de sorts. Personnellement je suis plus fan de ce système que du système bourrin.

Les nombreux combats que vous aurez à faire vous ferons gagner de l’expérience, qui, comme tout rpg qui se respecte, vous fera gagner des niveaux et des points de compétences à attribuer sur un arbre selon vos préférences.

Vous aurez aussi de nombreuses énigmes loin d’etre simple pour certaines, parcours « annexes » dans les donjons, ce qui est l’une des forces de TBT, vous aurez donc des énigmes non obligatoires à résoudre si vous le souhaitez, à condition d’avoir les outils nécessaire parfois, car les parcours annexes ont parfois besoin d’outils que vous ne trouverez pas dans les donjons que vous faites. Le parcours n’est donc pas linéaires

La bande son est magnifique mais je pouvais pas mettre plus de points positifs, et la durée de vie est longue.

Je vous conseille donc ce titre !",100

This is an indie strategy game series that started off with the original Banner Saga in early 2014. The second in the series came out in mid 2016. This series also has its own unique and distinctive artstyle that is loved by all those that have tried out the game.

*Gameplay*
As I have said, this is a turn based strategy game. You will control a small party of warriors in each combat sequence. After you defeat each enemy your party grows stronger and your characters earn some item drops. Those that are fans of turn based games or strategy games will surely love this game’s combat loop. It is also very inoffensive so that even those that aren’t too fond of turn based games or strategy games can still find enjoyment in Banner Saga 3.

The game also has a city builder aspect to it. There are 2 main groups you control. One is the village of your people. You must choose how you wish to lead your people. Do you wish to be benevolent and help the poor of the village or do you wish to use all your funds to improve the defences. Each choice matters and can have an impact on how your story ends. Meanwhile the other group is a bunch of warriors from the village who are in search of the ‘darkness’ to end the misery once and for all.

*Art and Sound*
Even taking one look at this game will give you a home-y feeling. This game has wonderful 2D aesthetics that look hand drawn. It has a warm feeling around it that makes you feel comfortable and pleasing to look at but at the same time you know you have a battle on your hands and need to stay focused to successfully complete the game. The sound compliments the art design of the game to perfection. 

*Story*
This is the third title in the Banner Saga series and as a result you will be jumping in to an ongoing story if you choose to start with this one. Don’t fret as you won’t feel lost although playing this game would make you want to go back and play the first two titles. If you are okay with spending a bit more money I’d highly finishing the games in order. The general story is of the people of the village you are controlling and their quest to vanquish the ‘darkness’(the big bad of the game) once and for all. I do not wish to spoil too much of the game so I won’t talk much about it but it is one of the best stories in gaming. The game also has multiple endings, you will definitely want to replay this game to try and find all the endings as it is so interesting. Heck, you will want to play all 3 games again as decisions in the first two games can influence the story here. Thankfully all the games are quite short so it doesn’t feel like a chore

*A True Masterpiece*
This game is a true masterpiece and stands alongside games such as The Witcher 3, GTA V, Bioshock series, Prey etc. On first sight while the game looks appealing it may not strike you as one capable of standing next to some of these other games but it’s just another example to not judge a book by it’s cover. The Banner Saga 3 is polished and does well in all departments. It’s not too expensive and has a good 10-15 hour campaign length, fit for the price. It also offers a ton of replayability that extends to the prequels in the series as well. Definitely a must buy

Aber es gibt auch ein paar Neuerungen, die Charaktere sind nun nicht mehr durch ein unsichtbares Seil aneinander gebunden, wenn also einer der Charaktere irgendwo hängen geblieben ist kann man einfach weiter laufen. Außerdem gibt es meistens wenn man in einem Gasthaus schläft vorher ein Gespräch zwischen Charaktere was den Charakteren mehr Tiefgang verleiht zudem sind diese Gespräche recht unterhaltsam und lustig.

On va déjà commencer par les graphismes du jeu qui sont complètement à gerber pour certains qui aime les tous nouveaux jeux mais si vous kiffer l'univers de One Piece, les personnages et défoncer des milliers de mec de la Marine, de loups, de lapins des neiges géants ou même les phoques kung-fu de Alabasta alors foncez ! Le jeu est une remasterisation de celui sur console et ne présente par d'avantage particulier il est tout simplement un classique des One Piece avec de nouveaux personnages comme ""Redfield"" ou ""Pato"" et d'autres qui vous demanderont de construire des bâtiments ou de faire des quêtes... On peut aussi faire de la pêche ou attraper des insectes pour par exemple : construire un musée, les utiliser pour améliorer ses armes etc... Un des grands avantages du jeu c'est que l'on retrouve les grands personnages classique comme Barbe Blanche, le dieu Ener, Ace, Akainu ce sale moche et d'autres... Nos personnages de l'équipe du chapeau de paille peuvent évoluer en montant des niveaux et on peut apprendre des techniques différentes sur chaque personnage. Attention à ce qui on une petite configuration car le jeu à tendance à crash sans raison ou simplement en faisant un ALT+TAB et vous n'avez pas sauvegardé donc, c'est embêtant mais moi qui ai une bonne configuration j'ai crash qu'une seule fois... Au niveau des boss, ils sont très facile à combattre et vous n'avez pas tellement besoin de réfléchir à ces mouvements pour trouver ses points faibles, vous avez juste à le mitrailler à coup de gum gum gatalinga ""gum gum rafale"" sinon on peut aussi utiliser la merveilleuse technique de Sanji ""POELE A FRIRE, SPECTRO !"" Donc pour le prix du jeu, je pense qu'il ne le vaut absolument pas, peut-être qu'il présente beaucoup de positif mais trop de négatif pour le prix de 40E... Je ne le conseille pas pour les gens à qui ça n'intéresse pas trop à One Piece et ceux qui n'aime pas les graphismes très bas. Pour ce qui finiront le jeu plus, il y a des quêtes disponible à la tavernes et même ENORMEMENT DE QUÊTES. Sur ce, je pense que j'ai tout dis, c'est mon premier commentaire sur Instant Gaming donc voilà je pense qu'il est pas mal ^^",70

Rappelez vous qu'un Hack'n'slash désigne un jeu qui a pour gameplay de déchirer des membres dans une horde d'adversaires et de gagner des récompenses pour décimer ces hordes de plus en plus rapidement.
Donner l'argument du gameplay répétitif démontre que vous ne comprenez pas que c'est le concept du jeu.
Il est là pour le défouloir pur et dur, le plaisir de jouer un jeu de la licence tout en déchirant des milliers de monstres.

Le jeu est plutôt bien réussi niveau graphismes et aussi du son, cependant il y a des problèmes :
-La résolution un peu faible qui rend le mode plein écran dégradé.
-Les musiques qui ne sont pas celles que nous avons l'habitude d'entendre. (mon conseil sera des les désactiver et de mettre les vôtres pour une meilleure expérience de jeu.)
-Certaines cinématiques (pas toutes) viennent des films déjà proposés par la licence : par rapport à ces cinématiques je tiens à préciser que la censure est présente seulement dans celles-ci mais pas en jeu, le gore y est bien présent.",80

Yes, the visuals are sub-par at best, yes, the roster is kind of lame, especially on the Marvel side, and yes, there isn't much single player content.

But at the end of the day, none of that really matters. What matters is how fun the game is, and, how well it runs. As it turns out, it's very, very fun. The game mechanics are wide open and pretty much allow you to do whatever you want, which is fantastic. 

Surprisingly, Capcom also finally managed to write good netcode. Actually, it's not just good, it's great. Maybe not quite on par with Killer Instinct (which is as good as it gets as far as fighting game netcode is concerned), but it's actually quite close, and years ahead of the garbage that was Street Fighter V's netcode.

After Street Fighter V, it's very hard for the fighting game community to admit that Capcom can still make a good fighting game. But they did. This game has great game mechanics, and great online, which is ultimately all that really matters.",90

The GRAPHICS are top notch, making some landscapes very realistic. Making it seem more like a photo than a video game.
Optimised for high and low performance computers. I was able to play it comfortably on a low budget laptop.

The GAMEPLAY is easy enough to get the hang on and yet full and more complex than a normal racing game. Good enough to make you want to get back in the game even after months of absence.

The STORY is a fair one. Not too complicated, therefore easy to follow. But as an essential part of a game, the main story left me unsatisfied, waiting for more. Which it shouldn't. Therefore i give it a lower rating than the other 2.

If you like racing games, this one is for you. There is no doubt. But as that - A racing game. You shouldn't expect a mind-blowing story because it focuses more on the experience of the gameplay.",80

En cuanto supe que saldría un juego de enanos (mi raza favorita por si no lo habeis notado), la alegria tomó el control de mi cuerpo. Un juego donde los protagonistas son enanos? y además.... todo gira alrededor de los enanos! ""defensores de la tierra protegida"", un titulo extraordinario para los que hasta hace bien poco habian sido simples NPCs. Compré el juego por el simple placer de ver enanos partiendo cabezas, pero me he llevado una grata sorpresa, un juego magnifico que ha pasado a ser de mis favoritos. He de admitir que es un juego extremadamente corto (6-8h si nos centramos en la misión principal y unas 13-17h si completamos todo el juego), pero creo que han sido los minutos que mas he disfrutado jugando a un videojuego, y no he jugado pocos... Empecemos con sus pros y contras, que a la mayoría os habré aburrido contandoos mi vida:

PROS:

+ Ambientación increible y mapas realmente detallados, graficamente muy atractivo (Las fortalezas enanas son magníficas).
+ Una de las mejores bandas sonoras que he escuchado.
+ Una historia atractiva: seguramente muchos digan que es una historia muy vista, pero la cuentan de tal manera que enamora. Te enganchas a la historia como si fuera ese libro al que le tienes tanto cariño.
+ Personajes inolvidables y ""humanos"": a lo largo de nuestra aventura nos encariñaremos con ciertos personajes (sobretodo con los gemelos y la enana en mi caso) y nos dolera muchisimo perder a alguien de nuestra compañia.
+ Diversidad de pensamientos, cada personaje es único: Es realmente asombroso como piensa cade personaje y como estos influyen en ti, no en el juego, si no en ti como persona. Cabe recalcar las diferentes opiniones que tienen sobre Giralda, por ejemplo.
+ El metodo que utiliza el juego para viajar (el mapa) me ha parecido muy buena idea ya que simplifica mucho las cosas y es divertido ver como se muve como si fuera un juego de mesa :D
+ Interfaz muy sencilla de utilizar
+ Se tocan temas como la diferencia de género (en el reino de los primeros), la traición (los terceros), mantenerse firme frente a la corrupción (los quintos), la importancia de los actos y no de tu procedencia (Tungdil)...

CONTRAS: HE DE RECALCARR QUE ESTOY HACIENDO ESTE ANALISIS DOS DIAS DESPUÉS DE LA SALIDA DE JUEGO, POR LO QUE PODRÍAN HABERSE SOLUCIONADO ALGUNAS COSAS

+ Algun que otro bug visual que no empeora la ambientación por lo general
+ La duración: quiero matar mas ALBOS/ORCOS/BICHOS MALOS! el inici del juego es relativamente lento pero en el final, en cambio, es como si todas las batallas estuviesen seguidas sin tiempo para descansar.
+ La camara se controla un poco mal y sus movientos son un tanto ortopedicos (este es el mayor defecto del juego a mi parecer)

RECOMENDABLE 100% comprarlo (no seais cenutrios y esperad a las rebajas que para algo estamos en steam...). Creo que en resumen, pese a los errores y bugs que tiene he disfutado más jugando este juego que skyrim (el cual era mi juego favorito hasta hace dos dias) xD.

Title: Pro Cycling Manager 2016
Developer: Cyanide Studios
Publisher: Focus Home Interactive

General Impression
First of all, I bought every PCM since Cycling Manager 2 so I think it's clear that it is a trustable review. I will be focussing this review mainly on the singleplayer side as the multiplayer side of the game is currently broken as at the release of every version of Pro Cycling Manager.

I'll talk briefly about the graphics first. The graphics look better when u first get into the game. I don't think they changed much graphical engine-wise but I think they updated their graphic filters slightly and that makes the game looks 10 times better, imo.

Gameplay-based and interface-wise, lots has changed in the race, but sadly not that much in the management interface. The biggest changes in the management interface are a new magazin/newspaper with an interview of a rider before every race, which is splendid because I remember reading that every time when I played it in 2006/2007. They also told me that the season goal's system changed drastically. If I look at it, I feel like they totally forgot to implement that because I don't see a difference at all. Nevertheless, I like the management bit and I didn't feel like much had to change anyway.

In-game, we see lots of changes, starting of with the splendid looking interface. It's not only captivatingly pretty, but it's also practical. I find it much easier with the length of the race being on the right bottom than on the left bottom, the other way around with the race profile. It's also great that they put the options on the right top instead of some small buttons at the right side of the screen like in previous editions. The biggest changes in-game are the Pro Cyclist Mode gameplay and the co-operation screen.

In the co-operation screen, you can see how fast u have to go to follow your group members but also the thoughts of your fellow breakaway members, which is splendid.

In Pro Cyclist Mode, it's much more about the team-game now instead of riding for yourself always. Finally... This happens because you get a role at the start of the race and your fellow team members give u missions at some time in the race. For example Froome can ask me ""Benji Naesen"" to protect him from the wind. Love that!

Breakdown
Class Creation like you’ve never seen
This game has an in-depth class creation system that is unlike anything you’ve ever seen in other game. It has all the standard stuff of being able to choose your race, gender, appearance, and attribute points. It is here that the fun begins. You can choose your character’s class, and based on your chosen class and attributes, you get to choose 3 abilities that you can use in combat (of which some have effects outside of combat as well). Then you choose some perks. These perks don’t offer any stat upgrades, but change the way you can play the game ever so slightly. I do talk about one specific ‘Pet Pal’ perk later on in the review. 

Next, you have what I find to be the most interesting part of this menu - the backstory. You can choose from a few predefined backstories for your character that give your character a few fixed perks, as well as some specific objectives in the main game, and change the way your character behaves slightly. You have a choice of around 10 stories and each one changes the way you play this game, offering immediate replayability. If you want to, you can also choose a blank character with no story and make your own way in this amazing world that Larian Studios have created. Making things even more interesting, you can also meet these other characters in the game and hear about their missions and backstories!

A proper RPG
One thing that I absolutely love about Divinity: Original Sin 2 is how it is a true RPG. What do I mean by this? Think of Skyrim, where there are actual consequences to your actions. There isn’t always a right or wrong choice to make. Sometimes, you will have to sacrifice a member of your party, and a future side quest might become unavailable to you because you needed that character. 

The other thing that makes this game a proper RPG is proper consequences to your ‘everyday actions’. If you want to take some goods from someone’s house, then don’t think you can walk in, loot everything and walk out with no consequences. If you are caught in the act, then you better run and not show your face in the town for a while. If you do and are caught by the authorities, then expect to spend some time in jail. What makes it all the more engaging is the amount of freedom you are given over your choices. You can send the remaining members of your party to break out the jailed member, or you can do some quests to collect the money for bail, or you can even just leave them there for a while! All in all, this is a proper RPG, unlike most modern RPGs where you can walk in to an NPCs house and rob them of everything while they treat you like a king from the get-go. 

Intricate story with a lot of replayability
The game has one of the best stories in a video game that I have ever experienced. It has twists and turns with many layers of depth. There are also a LOT of side quests, and they aren’t always fetch quests, or just there so you can grind up levels. Many of them add a lot of small bits to the story and game world. Learning more about the world naturally always adds to the satisfaction of completing the quests and, hence, immersion. On a side note, while this isn’t necessary, please take the ‘Pet Pal’ perk available at the start of the game. This perk will let you converse with animals, and you will have a lot of hilarious conversations with them. You will be able to get a lot of quests from these animals which you would usually miss out on if you didn’t have the perk. It’s highly recommended that you get this perk so that you can spice up your playthrough and make it even more enjoyable. 

Taking into account the impact of your decision in quests, character creation, and perks, it is obvious that the game branches out in a lot of paths, and you will surely miss out on a lot of content in a single playthrough. You could be on your 10th playthrough only to realize that there were several quests hidden in your previous playthrough only available now because of your choices. With how fun the game is, you will be replaying it a lot and still be discovering new things about the game. Simply put, this game has an amazing value for money in terms of both quality and quantity of the content.

For the negatives.. 
NOPE. There isn’t any part of the game that fails to deliver. Unlike how it can be with games of this design, even the combat is a great aspect of the game. Although some players may not enjoy turn based style combat, I must say that this is a thoroughly in-depth combat system similar to what is seen in games such as XCOM, which are purely based on their combat! Although the combat could have been tedious after you’ve played this game for about a hundred hours, I can’t say that I found it so (admittedly, I am a fan of turn based strategy games). I still enjoy it now! If you really dislike the combat, then it’s not a big deal. You can avoid a large number of combat engagements just by talking your way out of it! Another aspect of this game that makes it a true RPG.

One word: MASTERPIECE
This is the only word I can say that would do justice to this game. I have nothing to nitpick about with this game. It is an amazing experience even for players who don’t enjoy turn based combat! Oh, and not to mention Steam Workshop support for everyone’s favourite mods. You can find many mods that customize this game to your taste! You won’t regret getting this game.

It is an action-adventure, open world RPG by the renowned Polish studio CD Projekt Red. As you may have guessed by now, you play as a Witcher, a monster hunter capable of superhuman strength and reflexes having undergone mutations. Our protagonist Geralt is on a journey to find his adopted daughter Ciri, who has been missing for years. He must reach her before the Wild Hunt, a group of ethereal warriors trying to find her for her secret powers. Geralt is aided by a wide cast of friends and acquaintances including Yennefer and Triss, his lovers at points in life, Dandelion and Zoltan. The game has adult themes and requires a certain level of maturity to truly appreciate the intricately woven stories.

The game has many positives that it would be impossible to list them all but I shall try to shortlist the most remarkable ones. To start off, the game is set in a gorgeous world, that you are free to explore, that feels truly alive. From the icy mountains of Ard Skellige to the marshes of Velgen to the City of Novigrad, the different areas in the game have a distinct feel with their own culture and atmosphere. The devs have shown a lot of attention to the tiniest of details to make the world feel real. If you block a pedestrian’s way for too long; they get annoyed. It starts raining, and you see people run for some cover. You can even hear people sneezing and someone else shouting “bless you” at them. There are also tons of easter eggs for you to find in this massive world. You can find a prison akin to the one that contained Tyrion Lannister in the Game of Thrones series. Fan of Doctor Who? Well, you can find the Weeping Angels statues in the game, where they actually move each time you turn around! As for graphical fidelity, even 3 years after release, the game looks as good, if not better, than most AAA games that came out this year. Now that’s everything about the eye candies in the game. 

What can you actually do in the world? Well, A LOT! There are several quests, both main story and side quest. The care taken to craft even smallest of the side quests can be felt. You may even end up confusing side quests with main quests due to their depth and how some of them tie up with the main story. Each quest will give you several ways to tackle them and can even have several endings. which may end up impacting the final ending as well. You can also take up witcher contracts from notice boards to slay different kinds of monsters plaguing the villagers. And if you ever feel tired from the adventures, you can just roam around the game world challenging bar owners and shopkeepers to a game of Gwent, a card game that is now a standalone game of its own. If you take your time and try to finish as many quests as possible, then you will easily have 100+ hours of content in front of you. Even if you choose to rush through the game, you will have 50+hours to enjoy here. The skill tree also allows for different playstyles, depending on which skills you decide to buy and equip. You can invest your points into combat, magic or alchemy, with each offering a slightly different playstyle. These skills can further be enhanced by various mutagens. In the Blood and Wine expansion, you can also develop mutations that grant you further customization options. All in all, the variety of quests and skills allow you to play through the game differently giving it a fair degree of replayability. 

So what about the negatives? Well there aren’t many, and the few ones that I have are just nitpicks. The one that comes to mind is that the combat, along with movement, feels a bit clunky and lacking. You can tap the move key and Geralt will sort of lunge forward 3-5 step. This just feels heavy and not at all smooth, unlike the rest of the game. You can even get stuck because of smallest of bumps since you can’t jump during combat. This becomes a problem when fighting in closed space. Furthermore, In higher difficulties, there aren’t many combat paths that are viable; most notably, Alchemy-centric build isn’t a viable option in higher difficulties, preventing the combat from providing a true RPG experience.

Personally, I enjoyed my time with the game, but I had to keep telling myself not to look at it like a true RPG rather look at it more of an action adventure centred game. There are mods available to improve the combat, which was something that I really needed, and other quality of life changes for small nitpicks you might have. 

To sum it up, this is an amazing game, just not an amazing RPG. Go into this game not looking at the RPG tag attached to it, and you will enjoy it extensively. This game is definitely worth buying, and it will offer you a lot of quality content. The only people I would advise to be cautious are the ones that are either looking for an RPG in the style of the Divinity games, or the Elder Scrolls games, or those that want an amazing combat experience. Although, if you have issues with the latter on PC, you can always get a few mods to improve the combat.

This game is a solid 10/10.

Finally Hitman is back. I was disappointed by Absolution, it was a very dumbed down Hitman game, with only couple of good levels first being the best one. The new Hitman game gave everything I desired and more.

It is a completely different game. You’re being thrown into huge levels and must eliminate your targets. But unlike in Absolution you can choose countless ways to do that. You can explore the maps, find disguises and walk almost freely everywhere or you can sneak. You can kill innocent people or just knock them out. Shooting everyone will not work here like it worked in Absolution. You can make your game easy or hard depending on your playstyle. Sneaking while wearing suit might be very hard. If you get appropriate disguise you’re safe to walk around. So it’s up to you how to play. Disguise works differently now and has logic to it. If lets say you knock out a security guard and get his uniform, some security guards will get suspicious but most of them will not notice there's something wrong with you. Same goes for all other disguises, so while you can move freely you must avoid some people.

You can simply follow your targets and kill them, you can lure them into a bathroom by poisoning their drink and drown them in a toilet, you can set up an accident and electrocute or blow up your target. If you have a required tool you can disguise as mechanic for example and drop the lamp on your poor target. You can infiltrate the most secure zone, make your target think that you’re someone else, talk to him and then kill him. There are countless ways to achieve your goal. This game has really good replayability value, it has challenges and various timed events, so every playthrough can be totally different.

Graphics are really nice, can’t say anything bad about it. Game runs well, there’s many object on the screen and many things happening on the map, fps stays steady most of the time. Game looks brilliant, so much detail, so much going on.

Many people disliked episodic format. I personally liked it. There are couple of reasons why. First is that releasing episode after episode developers always can improve the next episode depending on user feedback. Another thing is, if you want to buy it day one you don’t need to spend 60€ on it, you buy one episode, save some money, buy another one, so it works better for people who can’t pay full price. It’s a shame if this was the reason why the game sold poorly. But I think there’s another reason to it which contributed to poor sales. Absolution…well…it wasn’t good, people were disappointed and were afraid to buy this one, especially when it’s released by Square Enix, I love them, own most of their games, but sometimes they make stupid decisions. But to my surprise this game has only one DLC and no pre-order. I hope the second season will follow the same formula – no DLC and pre-order bonuses.

Another thing people disliked is always online. I personally have no problems with that, but I can understand those who has. But hey it's 2017, who doesn't have internet these days?

So if you like absolute freedom, sandbox style gameplay, want many hours of enjoyment get this, you’ll not be disappointed.

But we do and FIFA is back with it's usual raft of tweaks designed to keep the game moving forward as well as the usual staple of fan favourites.

I recommend you buy this game below the current asking price, preferably when a miracle patch hits the live servers. Unfortunately, FatShark Games has a proven track record of doing things too little, too late, promising development road maps, only to implement changes very late into the game's life cycle.

PRO TIPS:

- Avoid opening any ""Commendation Chests"" (level up reward) you might earn, until you reach Power level 600 (max level, with max level items), so that you can INCREASE your chances of earning higher quality loot/future cosmetics in the 1.1 update

- If you're currently out of friends or co-op partners, I STRONGLY ADVISE using a Discord server such as Squirrel Squad or Blood Moon Inn to find players to play with

- Sadly, the game currently has a ""meta"" where certain class/weapon combinations are better than most, you can try what you like, but for those interested, right now (1.0.8.1 patch LIVE), most classes are useful with the exception of Sienna's Battle Wizard that suffers from badly designed class mechanics.

- Performance may vary. The game has exceptional issues and a very intrusive Anti-Cheat system that will use up PC resources during play time. Understand that the DX12 version isn't optimized properly yet, so if you don't have a modern PC, use DX11 for best performance (NOT graphical). You can switch Shadows and other optionals (such as High Quality Fur) OFF, since you won't gain that much of a visual benefit, as much as you'll get a nasty performance dip. 

REMEMBER: The game is VERY CPU intensive. If you have a weak CPU, I suggest going into the Launcher > Settings and changing the Worker Threads to 3 or 4 just to be safe. Also, if you want EASY games and have a BAD CPU, just host a game and you'll have an easier time since ALL ENEMIES use real time scripts that take up a lot of CPU power for the purposes of calculating pathing, behavior etc.

Not only the controls feel much better, the new gadgets like the (Bavarium powered) wingsuit and the retracting tethers alone sell it for me. Out of ammo? Just pull a helicopter into a gas tank and watch it explode. The world design is just amazingly done and beautiful. It is smaller than Panau from Just Cause 2, but also better filled with interesting landmarks and a better variety of things to blow up. Yes the story and characters are as cheesy as they can get. But do you really expect some serious characters with a rich and interesting past to tell you about? This game is just like it's predecessors a playable action movie with a lot of freedom where you can play with your creativity.

But there is a few big downside which are pretty much unnecessary and could've been avoided in making this game. 

downside:+ a few negative points under this text
performance
The performance is sometimes and without tweaking a catastrophe. My PC is high-end and so way over the recommended requirements (i7 7700k, 16GB ram, GTX1070, game installed on SSD) and the FPS sometimes just tank down to ~40 FPS. But that luckily rarely happened in my hours of play time. A simple restart of the game also fixed that for me. 

There is a very helpful guide in the steam guides posted that helps fixing the performance completely. Aside from the framedrops that I mentioned earlier the game ran always at over 60 FPS with all settings on maximum.

Repetetive 
The whole game feels this way, from the stories to the bases to .. everything. They did well giving another look to each base for sure but it does not feel as rewarding as it was in Just Cause 2. 

All in all I would still recommend this game to everyone who likes a good action open world sandbox, even though the setup is annoying. But the fun you will get out of this game is worth taking the 10 minutes to configure it. As long as you don't tab out of the game of course. :p

Ganz ehrlich? WOW!

Ich selbst bin ja eher einer der seine Spiele etwas gröber mag, mit Action, Gewalt, nicht alzu Komplex!

Nun sah ich Every Body`s gone to the Rapture und war erstmal von der Optik angetan (Ersteindruck halt) und dann sofort von der Story und dem Setting! Was mich vom kaufen abhielt war dieses Wort ""Walkingsimulator"", den für sowas habe ich eigentlich keine Gedult! Ich schreibe dies gerade da viele sicher genauso denken und eventuell am überlegen sind! Nunja, ich habe es mir dann doch einmal gegönnt und siehe da, ich habe mich gleich ""wohl"" gefühlt im Spiel, mir nen Snack geholt und bin einfach mal losgelaufen! 

Wir befinden uns in einem nahezu freibegehbaren Dorf was wirklich riesig ist und welches vor ca 37min verlassen wurde! Von nunan heist es laufen, was aber doch nicht so langweilig ist wie man meinen mag, man muss es meiner Meinung nach auch nicht mögen denn man ist die meiste Zeit wirklich damit beschäftigt sich die wunderschöne umgebung anzusehen und dem Soundtrack zu lauschen welcher auch fantastisch ist! Auf jeden 2ten Meter gibt es sachen zu entdecken welche uns immer mehr in das geschehen einbinden und das Geheimnis um das Dorf offenbaren! Dies wird einerseits durch PC`s und Radios wiedergegeben, wiedeerum durch Plakate und Gegenstände wo man so einiges erahnen bzw sich zusammenraimen kann! Bisschen Fantasy ist gefragt :) An einigen ecken wird man auch durch so eine Art ? Anomaly? durch die Geschichte und die Ereignisse geführt! Kann man sich vorstellen wie in The Vanishing of Ethan Carter! Dies geht einem schonmal an die Nieren! An einer Stelle läuft man zB auch über einen Spielplatz wo man noch Kinder lachen hört!

Viel mehr gibt es soweit nicht zu tun, klingt etwas langweilig aber ist es keine Sekunde! 

Kurz:
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture ist ein wunderschönes Spiel mit tollen Soundtrack und einem super Storytelling was selbst mich als meider solcher Games sofort in den Bann gezogen hat! Licht aus, Chips raus und unterhalten lassen !

Was Technik und Buggs etc angeht konnte ich bis jetzt absolut nichts feststellen!

Les bonus de sorciers au fil de leur progression, le grimoire avec ses sorts et potions est vraiment un ajout cohérent avec l'ensemble des fonctionnalités proposées et on sent que les créateurs se sont donné de manière globale sur ce pack.
Mais il y a un goût d'inachevé, les familiers sont bien mignons mais n'apportent rien en particulier et ne sont limite là que pour faire joli. Les maîtres sorciers ne sont pas exploités au maximum : j'aurais aimé avoir la possibilité de me spécialiser dans un domaine ou de faire devenir maître l'un de mes sims or ce n'est pas possible.

Some racing simulations such as the old Superbike games and recent MotoGP offerings have come close, but now there’s a road bike sim that completely raises the bar.
Ride 3, available on PS4, Xbox One and PC, is the Gran Turismo for bikes. Featuring hundreds of bikes from classics to Ducati's new V4 Panigale, you can re-live almost any era you like - whether that’s ragging a Suzuki RGV250 around Oulton Park or mastering the Nurburgring’s Nordschleife on a BMW S1000RR. 
The range of tracks is impressive - 30 to be precise - including biking mecca Cadwell Park, Oulton, Brands Hatch and Donington in the UK, as well as Portimao, Monza, Imola, Vallelunga, Magny Cours, Road America, Sugo and the Nurburgring overseas.
It’s not just track riding either, there are several road courses too, including the North West 200, Ulster Grand Prix and Imatra as well as a number of fictional roads circuits designed to test your ability its just a shame they couldn't add the Isle Of Man TT to there list of tracks and also a few more British tracks so you can have bsb championship. 
The circuits are eerily accurate, the level of graphics games have reached these days is insane – it is almost like you are physically at the circuit you’re racing through your television.
The physics are as good as any bike game gets; the throttle does what you’d expect it do and it's the same for the brakes. You can alter the difficulty for a greater, or easier challenge but the key thing is the bike behaves like a bike should, which has been a huge problem for bike games in the past.
You can edit your livery, tune your bikes to an unbelievable level and career mode takes you through a series of 50 magazines (we appreciate the nod to the media!) featuring different race challenges on different styles of bikes. You can lose hours…
For race fans, there are a number of World Endurance, road racing and BSB bikes available for purchase… so rather than trying to knock ten seconds off your lap time on a Donington trackday you can put yourself on Shane Byrne’s Be Wiser Ducati and try and beat the BSB pole record.

The graphics are not great but work well for what the game is, game play is great. Audio could have been better if they had some voice over stuff but planes sound fine, but I get it. This is coming for a small company with this game only under belt. I would have like more of a co op to the game. I can invite my steam friends but can not find other people playing in the game and invite them. Maybe that something they will add in an update. I hope they keep adding to the game, Tau, Eldar and Necrons would be great too.

Do I think this game is worth $24.99? That's a hard, this game can have be worth $25 but it will need a lot more race's and planes. It's cheaper then playing the real tabletop version and you don't need to build and paint the planes. Yes, it will be worth $25 dollars with updates and expansion and that's if you don't have to pay for the expansions. Get it if you like Game Workshop games or you are interested in it. Go watch some gameplay on twitch or youtube. For me this was the same price as if I went or order to food for the night. If you do get it look me up, I'm always done to play.

Call of Duty: Ghosts is here and is really in the ordinary Call of Duty-fashion.

""So we can't change too many of the core rules, and the core rules are really simple. You're a player, it's in first-person, you have a weapon in your hand and you run around shooting other people."" 

The words above come from Infinity Wards executive producer Mark Rubin and is about the Call of Duty series. He draws a parallel between the incredibly popular game series and football, and says that if one of the sport's suddenly decided to only have seven players on the pitch and that you also get to use your hands, the people would loose interest and stop attending matches.
This conservative philosophy exist for the huge crowd of fans of the series who will recognize it and not get lost in strange novelties. 
And it has left a distinct mark on the new addition to Call of Duty: Ghosts, as in every way, this is exactly what one would expect of a new game in the series.

The campaign begins in an idyllic American place where you sit and talk with your father and brother.
In ordinary Call of Duty-fashion, there are not many minutes before the first explosion color the sky red and the everything falls into chaos. 
Bombs are slamming into the right and left, buildings destroyed before your eyes and you have to survive at any cost.
It starts out pretty good with a premise that arouses interest. 
The South American Federation takes control of the weapon Odin and kills millions of American citizens with bombs. When they have the upper hand they invade the injured shot nation that relies on it feared special dressing Ghosts to turn things around and win the war against all odds.

The campaign is just as exciting and intense as one would expect, with so many explosions that you almost get a nice tan in front of the screen. In a never-ending stream of scenes, we take us through runaway trains, drive a snowmobile across frozen lakes, deep dive among sharks and visit the vacuum of space while we are shooting thousands of opponents to death.
But unfortunately, while the campaign is very full of action, it's completely brain dead. 
Some scenes are so stupid that I just laugh out straight. Clichés succeed each other and to say the least incredible sequence of events is explained with intrigue that could have been written by monkeys at the zoo. 
Or how about a good guy transformed into a vicious sadist who's fed with crops from the South American 

And we have it here with the Call of Duty dog. Infinity Ward assured that we would care about this mutt that comes with along the way, but that is not the case, and the question is rather if they tried to achieve that goal at all. My dog is acting in a fairly useless in a Supporting Role as quickly wasted and then fall in total oblivion. Infinity Ward know their explosions and ""follow the leader with Weapons"" torques, but to tell a believable and interesting story, they really can't.
Fortunately, the multiplayer is still the series' strengths and savior. For the most part, I'm having a lot of fun with the various play modes. My favourite mode is ""hunted"" - a situation where one armed with a pistol at the beginning of the round and then must collect crates to get access to better firepower. Free for all on the game's smallest maps are wonderfully chaotic with the perfect balance between chance and skill.

For me, standing just outside the core group who love the series for what it is, it becomes problematic with few functioning news. Should not a giant company, Activision, with all the money resounding success of Call of Duty draws in, deliver something bigger? Something that makes me lose my breath as nails sticking controller in my hands and pushing me to defy feelings of fatigue and hunger?
There are probably things you don't have time for when a new game is to be replaced every year - then it might just be more of the same. 
Which in the case of Call of Duty: Ghosts works very well because its heart-racing action as the series' hallmark still stands up so well in the competition and delivers an entertaining multiplayer experience.

The question is: How long does it?",70

As a die-hard fan of RPGs and sandboxes, there’s a special place in my mind for The Elder Scrolls Franchise. Since I was introduced to the series back in 2002, I’ve spent hundreds of hours navigating the immense fantasy-themed world of Bethesda in search of adventure, loot, NPCs, and the gorgeous views of surrounding landscapes. It’s a real MMORPG video game released by ZeniMax Online Studios. The game serves as a part of the long-running The Elder Scrolls series and introduces lots of prominent features that you have never seen before. Honestly, there’s nothing about Massively Multiplayer Online games that I dislike; however, I intend to go with freedom of playing solo adventures over guild-based raids. But I’m happy that at least I tried, and I liked it.

Background Story – Be a Hero
The game starts with your favorite character, who escapes from the prison in the daedric realm, Coldharbour. According to the plot, the daedric prince Malog Bal has stolen your soul, with the help of a few new allies, and you return to Tamriel as a vestige. After reaching there, you must spend a hundred hours to complete the challenging quests to approach the level cap of 50. The difficulty level will start increasing with level 10, and the advancement in missions will unlock new stuff. It offers content-driven gameplay and will allow you to experience excellent gameplay with other players from all over the world.
Highly Detailed Environment and Monthly Subscription Model
Similar to other titles in The Elder Scrolls franchise, the game takes place in the continent of Tamriel and introduces a well-written storyline that is indirectly attached to different titles. Like other MMORPGs, the game introduces the monthly subscription model, and it means you must pay monthly charges to keep continuing your gaming service. During the gameplay, you can explore the environment from a third-person perspective to kill other players or enemies to retrieve your soul to become the master. While playing the game, you can use a variety of melee weapons and other gear to earn in-game currency.

Gameplay – What’s new?
Like the previous installment, the game focuses on non-linear gameplay, introduces a perfect combination of free-roaming, random events, quests, and epic battles. Although the game doesn’t present a Single-player offline play, the developers said that there would be a variety of content specially designed for those users who prefer to play solo. There are ten different races categorized into three types, such as:
• Elvish Races
• Humans
• Bestial Races
Before start playing the game, the ultimate job of the player is to choose one of three races and then go with character classes to choose his favorite one out of six, such as:
• Sorcerer
• Templar
• Nightblade
• Dragonknight
• Warden
• Necromancer
You would be happy to know that each class is offering you various attacks, passive effects, and spells.

Setting and Combat System
The world where the game takes place is expansive, but it doesn’t calibrate your sense against other titles available in the series. A limited distance, repetitive buildings, and scenery make you feel the game is smaller than it seems on a map. The main problem is that each zone is offering a single region for players of a specific level range, and as you advance through the game, further zones will be unlocked to navigate. The objectives you complete directly fall into a few categories, including Fetch Quests, Kill Lists, and Simple Object Finding. The complicated combat system of the game hybridizes the traditional Massively Multiplayer Online Rotation System, where the player can cycle through a set of skills and magical powers.

Final Verdict
The Elder Scrolls Online comes with outstanding gameplay, although a few well-structured systems are struggling to overcome lifeless presentation, but tough to recommend. There’s one flaw in the PvP event that the map is too large to explore. Combat was brilliant when I involved in it but found myself wasting lots of hours from reaching one place to another.

The game itself is what you have to adress, not the xbox live service.
Purchased for steam. Lots of hours playing, the game is a masterpiece. Specially for people of the 80s and 90s, that play everything except nowadays trash like fifa, fornite or call of duty, AIDS for gaming.
The graphics are awesowe, the game would.t be a hit with pixel art. Anyway you have the starring charactters handrawed, and the versions of Sor 1,2 and 3 in pixel art so no excuses.
The music is in the line of the saga, epic, brutal, a monster! Also you have the option to use old bgm of Sor 1 and 2, again no complains.
The game uses a new feature of combos, and is the base to understand the new mechanics. 
The levels are very different and long enough, we have 12 levels. 
The difficulty is a bit harder thatn previous games, with peaks of really easy to really hard (playing in normal). So if you don´t want to be slaughtered, I recommend you to start in easy, to understand the new enemies, mechanics and combos, and after the first completed game, go for normal.
A dream made true to all fans of this awesowe saga, 26 years waiting for it and it deserves the long wait.

In Darksiders 2 you will play as one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Death.

Death, will try to clear his brother War’s name by restore humanity, where War is convicted by destroying it. The story line was interesting and in my opinion it could be better, but in general it’s fine. Even though the world in Darksiders 2 is way bigger than the previous game, but it wasn’t good since there is not that much to explore. I guess the reason is so the can add more side quests and give the game more hours. the game comes with new skill system, where you have two paths, but still can mix each path skill with another. You have Harbinger Tree (Warrior path) and Necromancer Tree (Spellcasting path).

I liked the fact they didn’t make it like the previous game where you can buy your skills, but sill I don’t think it should be that much of skills. War as in the previous game has only four skills and they were perfect as they suite its character, which is the opposite in this game, even though his name is Death, you won’t feel the meaning of his name, except his Reaper form. I fact that you get gold after slaying an enemy when it was a souls in the last game it’s really confusing, since you use them to purchases items from demon called Vulgrim, who mentioned that he have no use of gold in Darksiders 1 and asked for souls as currency. And since we playing with Death, the souls will suit it more.

Weapons system I really didn’t like, in this game they allowed you to use different varieties of weapon; such as, Hummer, Swords, maces and etc, beside Death main weapon Scythe. the problem is unlike the previous game where you can use only War’s sword (Chaoseater), and the more you kill the more Chaoseater become strong and upgraded. In Darksiders 2 the Scythes are not different than other weapons. All these extra thing killed the character, you barley can see him as death. Even his agility, the way he moves, walk on walls doesn’t suit Death. Which makes you wonder how are they gonna deliver Strife character (One of Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse).

The graphics isn’t bad at all, and I hope they won’t change it.

To sum up, the game was a big surprise where there is a huge difference between it and the previous one. Even though they fail to deliver Death character as it should be, you will mostly like and enjoy the fights and the character. the story was great and really interesting. I hope the make the next game more like the first one, more Action than RPG as it suit the story and the characters more.",80

It is a must buy for every DBZ fan (and not only) who can afford it. 

Storyline 10/10

I really like the idea of the storyline. Basically, you make your own character (you can choose between Saiyan, Human, Majin, Namekian and Freeza's race) and you travel in time with Trunks because some of the events are changing (for example Vegeta kills everyone when he first arrives on Earth) so you have to help. Those changes are caused by 2 persons which appear only in the game. You can also do parralel quests either alone or with other players and you can even speak with them. This game is playable both online and offline ( you can play it with a friend if you have 2 controllers).

Graphics 8/10

It kind of resemble the original series so it's not the best one. I like the fact that you have better combat system and far more abilities.

Themes / music 8/10

I don't really like the in-game themes but the intro is really awesome (at least for me).

Overall 9/10

A good thing is that you can select the voice language (English or Japanese). Some characters can be unlocked only when you meet certain requirements. Most of the abilities (if not all) can be bought from the in-game store a certain amount of in-game currency (Zeni, so you don't need real money), for example Super Saiyan (ultimate ability) can be bought when you reach a certain level (16 I think) for 50000 Zeni. It can only be purchased by the ones who made a character from the Saiyan race. It also respects the original one so it drains your Ki pretty quickly. Overall, the game is really nice and you have a lot of things to do in it.

Ich liebe die Grafik die dank RayTraicing echt mega aussieht und auch das spielprinzip macht mega spaß man hat superkräfte und besiegt gegner mit einem Schlag aus der Luft oder wirft ihnen ein felsblock per telekinese ins gesicht .
Leider ist der Schwierigkeitsgrad nicht anpassbar und ich als eher unterdurchschnittlich talentierter larry bin echt oft gestorben gut daran ist das man nur 10% quelle verliert was quasi absolut egal ist da man durch alles quelle verdient im spiel und man keinen fortschritt verliert. dennoch frustrierend für mich immer zu sterben . Trotzdem habich alle quest geschafft auch wenn ich teils bis zu 15 anläufe für einen boss gebraucht hatte und trotzdem hat mir am ende meine quelle gereicht um alle waffen vollaufzurüsten und auch die werkstatt auf max zu bringen.
Zudem stört mich etwas das man bei quests keine marker bekommt wo etwas ist man kann nur über tab die map aufrufen wo einem das gebiet gezeigt wird indem man probe x oder gegner y besiegen muss.
sehr gut gefallen hat mir das teils die quests sehr kreativ sind oder zumindest die level cool umgesetzt wurden so muss man beispielsweiße einmal zu einer ampel und wird jedesmal zurückgesetzt wenn man sich bewegt oder reißt in eine spiegeldimension indem man sein Spiegelbild bekämpft und viele weitere solcher coolen ideen sind gut umgesetzt worden.
Die Dialoge mit NPCs oder zwischensequenzen sind leider im deutschen eher schlecht vertont teils auch mit ewiglangen aussetzern wo der npc redet und erst sekunden später der ton der deutschen synchro kommt.
Was mich auch gestört hat war das immer wieder gegner respawnen in bestimmten bereichen was eig nur nervig ist für mich was aber persönlicher geschmack ist nur sind diese respawns meist keine herausforderung sondern ziehen das spiel so einfach unnötig in die länge.
Auch hat das spiel das klassische problem das man am beginn echt unter dem niveau der gegner ist da man echt wenig schaden verteilt aber schnell stirbt und gegen ende hin haben auch unmengen an standartgegnern keinerlei chance gegen mich da ich sie easy mit meinem fähigkeiten hops nehme hier hätte die balance etwas besser sein können.
Alles in allem ist das meckern auf sehr hohem niveau da mir das spiel so gut gefallen hat das ich mir nun die erweiterung holen werde, gerade weil das spiel aber so gut in punkten wie Grafik Gameplay Kreativität etc ist ist es mir umso wichtiger die nicht so gelungenen stellen herauszustellen. Auch lesefaule werden bei der Komplexen story wohl nicht ganz auf ihre kosten kommen da man viele Informationen über die geschehnisse der spielweltt durch gefunde akten nachlesen kann und dadurch im kontext auf gegner etc schließen kann .
Auch sind die NPCs trotz der dramatischen situation in der sie sich befinden eingesperrt und täglich mit dem tod konfrontiert zu entspannt und locker es scheint sie gar nicht zu stören wie es ist nichtmal die paar NPCs die kurz vor dem tod stehen oder wissen das es gleich aus ist scheint das kaum zu stören. so das wars aber mit meckern auch wenn es sich nicht so anhört ist das eine absolute kaufempfehlung",90

No činjenica da je ovo dobro odrađen posao i da će svi ljubitelji RPG igri, 100% zajamčeno, uživati u ovoj igri stoji, a samim time kupnja Minecraft Dungeons igre je opravdana! Ja kao stari gejmer (Darko zFader iz GameNOEL gaming tima), odmah sam zavolio ovu igru. Na kupnju igre odlučili smo jer je mene uvelike podsjetila na dobri stari Diablo II i NOX (vi stariji gejmeri znati ćete o čemu pričam), dok je Noela (mlađi član GameNOEL gejmerskog klana s YouTube kanala GameNOEL :) ), zaluđen samim Minecraftom i survajvanjem, bez nekog prevelikog iskustva igranja RPG-ova, ima iskustvo igranja Magicite igre, objeručke prihvatio RPG Minecraft! Ovo je igra u kojoj će mlađi igrači dobit nešto više zadovoljštine ali samo zato jer je vrlo jednostavna za nučiti igrati. Dobar je korak ka složenijim RPG-ovima, a svi stariji biti ćete sretni zbog onog ushita, naleta sreće koji će vam Minecraft Dungeons dati, naravno ako ste ljubitelj RPG igri, bez da vam oduzme mjesece života igrajući. Da, Minecraft Dungeons je vrlo kratka igra i može se je odigrati u jednom brzom hodu,naravno bez traženja tajnih prolaza i škrinji, samo čisto jednostavno jurenje kroz levele. Što nam se najviše dopalo je da je igra u početku vrlo jednostavna i igriva a što se ide dalje u levele zadaci i sama igra postaju zahtjevniji i stoga nećete brzo izgubiti interes u samu igru.

- The world of Sea of Thieves is beautiful. Sailing across the (beautifully rendered) open ocean is a blast in the first few hours of the game. You will encounter storms, reefs, small and big islands, a kraken (if you're lucky) and, of course, others Pirate Ships.

- Pepper enemy ships with cannonball or shoot your friend directly at them, ram their ship, board them or use black powder keg to sink them. There are many ways for you to win a battle against others Pirates. With every player having access to the same weapons and ships, there is no unfair advantage in Sea of Thieves.

- The ""meat"" of the game however is your crew. Sea of Thieves is a good sandbox, but any sandbox is only as fun as the friends you're with.

The Bad :

- Right from the start, the game hit you with a ridiculous design choice : the character ""creator"". In Sea of Thieves, the character creator has been replaced by a character selector. The game display eight randomly-generated characters for you to choose from and if none of them suits you, you can ask for eight new randomly-generated ones. Want a black-haired girl that doesn't look like a car-crash victim ? Good luck to you, you might be here for a while !

- The islands are almost entirely lifeless. You can see them all in about a day of play, and they almost never house anything interesting other than your quest objective. The outposts are the only place you will ever encounter any friendly NPCs and each of those outpost offers you the exact same buildings and the same nine NPCs. They don't move from their spot, they don't interact with each other, and they only offer you a few lines of dialogue. And if you ever see another player in one of those outpost, he will probably try to kill you on sight.

- The combat system is simplistic with only three guns, no cover system (not even crouch), and with a cutlass that can only hit or block. 

- Sneaking onto an enemy ship is practically impossible. Every time a player go to far from his ship, a Siren appears near him, effectively revealing his position. Sometimes, the game itself will transport you back to your ship without even asking.

The Evil :

- All three factions feel the same with nearly identical, radiant fetch quests that have you go to X island to get X thing and return without sinking/dying.

- Enemy variety is almost non-existent, skeletons, snakes and an ""endgame boss"" kraken that has already been turned into a meme by players, as the thing is just tentacles with no actual body lurking under the water.

- Progression is entirely cosmetic and while you can change your ship’s sails and paint, there are fundamentally still only two kinds of ships in this entire pirate game. If the only progression in a game is cosmetic, you should be allowed to change more than just the color of your ship ! ",40

First of all: I know this is a common complaint, and yes, it is short, but hey, the original one and Resident Evil 2 weren't that much longer, either, so I don't really see a problem with this. It's a fun return to a classic, but at the same time it manages to stay fresh and even enhance the 1999 version with some new directions.

Granted, it might not be as surprising as the RE2 Remake, and uses basically the same survival horror formula, but I think fans like myself will love it. There's horror, action, an exciting story, characters to cheer for, and a badass enemy following you around - pure, authentic RE experience!

This is an indie strategy game series that started off with the original Banner Saga in early 2014. The second in the series came out in mid 2016. This series also has its own unique and distinctive artstyle that is loved by all those that have tried out the game.

*Gameplay*
As I have said, this is a turn based strategy game. You will control a small party of warriors in each combat sequence. After you defeat each enemy your party grows stronger and your characters earn some item drops. Those that are fans of turn based games or strategy games will surely love this game’s combat loop. It is also very inoffensive so that even those that aren’t too fond of turn based games or strategy games can still find enjoyment in Banner Saga 3.

The game also has a city builder aspect to it. There are 2 main groups you control. One is the village of your people. You must choose how you wish to lead your people. Do you wish to be benevolent and help the poor of the village or do you wish to use all your funds to improve the defences. Each choice matters and can have an impact on how your story ends. Meanwhile the other group is a bunch of warriors from the village who are in search of the ‘darkness’ to end the misery once and for all.

*Art and Sound*
Even taking one look at this game will give you a home-y feeling. This game has wonderful 2D aesthetics that look hand drawn. It has a warm feeling around it that makes you feel comfortable and pleasing to look at but at the same time you know you have a battle on your hands and need to stay focused to successfully complete the game. The sound compliments the art design of the game to perfection. 

*Story*
This is the third title in the Banner Saga series and as a result you will be jumping in to an ongoing story if you choose to start with this one. Don’t fret as you won’t feel lost although playing this game would make you want to go back and play the first two titles. If you are okay with spending a bit more money I’d highly finishing the games in order. The general story is of the people of the village you are controlling and their quest to vanquish the ‘darkness’(the big bad of the game) once and for all. I do not wish to spoil too much of the game so I won’t talk much about it but it is one of the best stories in gaming. The game also has multiple endings, you will definitely want to replay this game to try and find all the endings as it is so interesting. Heck, you will want to play all 3 games again as decisions in the first two games can influence the story here. Thankfully all the games are quite short so it doesn’t feel like a chore

*A True Masterpiece*
This game is a true masterpiece and stands alongside games such as The Witcher 3, GTA V, Bioshock series, Prey etc. On first sight while the game looks appealing it may not strike you as one capable of standing next to some of these other games but it’s just another example to not judge a book by it’s cover. The Banner Saga 3 is polished and does well in all departments. It’s not too expensive and has a good 10-15 hour campaign length, fit for the price. It also offers a ton of replayability that extends to the prequels in the series as well. Definitely a must buy

This game is a true masterpiece and stands alongside games such as The Witcher 3, GTA V, Bioshock series, Prey etc. On first sight while the game looks appealing it may not strike you as one capable of standing next to some of these other games but it’s just another example to not judge a book by it’s cover. The Banner Saga 3 is polished and does well in all departments. It’s not too expensive and has a good 10-15 hour campaign length, fit for the price. It also offers a ton of replayability that extends to the prequels in the series as well. Definitely a must buy

Como treinador é possivel para o jogador comprar jogadoreswde modo a melhorar o seu clube, alterar ou criar tacticas completamente novas e mexer na equipa tecnica, tornando-se assim um verdadeiro treinador de bancada. 

O jogo incorpora também um sistema de ligas que permite jogar em varias ligas ao longo da carreira e até tornar-se treinador de uma seleção nacional. 

No que toca aos graficos estes são bons o suficiente para este tipo de jogo,embora haja espaço para melhoria, já os menus são bastantes acessiveis e há a opção de os modificar, tornando-os bastante faceis de usar.

In der Spielwelt gibt es viel zu erkunden und zu sammeln. Man kann seine eigene Landwirtschaft betreiben und alle gesammelten oder hergestellten Gegenstände dann sogar in einem eigenen Shop verkaufen. Wem dann noch etwas Action fehlt, kann im Dungeon gegen Monster kämpfen. Was uns bei der Steuerung ein wenig gestört hat, ist das Platzieren von Gegenständen oder das Graben von Feldern zum säen. Es ist dabei schwierig, einigermaßen akkurat und gradlinig zu bleiben. Das Spiel ist grundsätzlich auch nicht sehr anspruchsvoll, aber durch den reichen Inhalt, bietet es trotzdem Langzeit-Spaß. Wir finden nur, dass die UVP zu hoch angesetzt ist, daher würden wir das Spiel eher im Sale empfehlen.

No činjenica da je ovo dobro odrađen posao i da će svi ljubitelji RPG igri, 100% zajamčeno, uživati u ovoj igri stoji, a samim time kupnja Minecraft Dungeons igre je opravdana! Ja kao stari gejmer (Darko zFader iz GameNOEL gaming tima), odmah sam zavolio ovu igru. Na kupnju igre odlučili smo jer je mene uvelike podsjetila na dobri stari Diablo II i NOX (vi stariji gejmeri znati ćete o čemu pričam), dok je Noela (mlađi član GameNOEL gejmerskog klana s YouTube kanala GameNOEL :) ), zaluđen samim Minecraftom i survajvanjem, bez nekog prevelikog iskustva igranja RPG-ova, ima iskustvo igranja Magicite igre, objeručke prihvatio RPG Minecraft!

Dobar je korak ka složenijim RPG-ovima, a svi stariji biti ćete sretni zbog onog ushita, naleta sreće koji će vam Minecraft Dungeons dati, naravno ako ste ljubitelj RPG igri, bez da vam oduzme mjesece života igrajući. Da, Minecraft Dungeons je vrlo kratka igra i može se je odigrati u jednom brzom hodu,naravno bez traženja tajnih prolaza i škrinji, samo čisto jednostavno jurenje kroz levele. Što nam se najviše dopalo je da je igra u početku vrlo jednostavna i igriva a što se ide dalje u levele zadaci i sama igra postaju zahtjevniji i stoga nećete brzo izgubiti interes u samu igru.

This remake was developed by Purple Lamp Studios, and published by THQ Nordic, who you might know from Darksiders, great game. 

The game was released for PC, Xbox One and PS4, but I’ve only played it on PC so I can’t tell you what performance is like on other platforms. Also worth noting this isn’t a comparison review, it’s a review of the remake, and yes there will be a few comparisons, maybe. 
Let’s move on to Story & Gameplay. 

STORY AND GAMEPLAY

So this being a SpongeBob game, you should expect a SpongeBob story, meaning a silly, ridiculous and nonsensical story. And that’s exactly what it is: Plankton wants to take over using robots, but fails terribly when he forgets to set the robots to “Obey” mode, and it’s up to SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy, to save Bikini Bottom.

Like I said, it’s a spongebob game, and story wise, it’s got everything you could possibly expect from a spongebob story. It’s just pure silliness, that’s all. It’s not gonna be for everyone, obviously if you don’t like SpongeBob, well I’d say you’ll quickly get annoyed by the childishness of the game. And I’ll be honest, sometimes SpongeBob’s laugh or the humour of the game got on my nerves a bit, but I felt like it was a bit unfair to complain since that’s literally what SpongeBob is, silly childish humour. 

Other than that there really isn’t much else to say about the story. The game is divided into the three sections of Bikini Bottom, and each section contains several areas for you to explore. In each of these areas you can switch between certain characters to solve certain puzzles, and your goal is essentially to find as many Golden Spatulas so you can open other areas. You usually will be getting these by completing little objectives or collecting objects, but you can also trade currency and collectibles for them too. By the way, there’s a total of 10 areas, and most of them have other characters in them which’ll give you mini objectives to complete for a spatula.

So there’s actually quite a fair amount to do, really. Naturally, it’s not an open world game filled with side quests and whatnot, but it’s got a good amount of content. There’s also a few bosses you get to fight. In terms of how the game actually plays, well, like I said you get to control three characters, Spongebob, sandy and patrick, and they’ve each got different attack sets, and Spongebob can learn different moves throughout the game. That’s pretty much it.

Gameplay wise the game really isn’t complicated, it’s a mix of simple combat and platforming, and it works very well for this particular game. You’ve gotta remember, it was probably aimed at younger audiences, so it’s just important to take the game for what it is.

The game also ran very smoothly, I never had any crashes or fps drops or anything like that.

I do have one or two complaints though, which I think are reasonable, since these concern the technical aspect of the game. I did encounter some bugs such as getting stuck here and there, and my only other complaint, is that the game tends to reset progress for some objectives sometimes. I’m not talking about enemies here, that respawn when you exit an area, but sometimes the game would reset some progress I’d made because I died, and it could be a bit frustrating at times, admittedly. 

Other than that, really nothing bad to say. Typical spongebob story accompanied by simple, fluid gameplay. Pretty chill and easy going on the whole. 

VISUALS

When it comes to visuals & graphics, I must say this game looks pretty good. It’s to be expected, of course, we are in 2020 after all, but the game looks very visually pleasing, and the colour palette is one my eyes certainly enjoyed. The colours didn’t feel over saturated, they didn’t pop out too too much, it was just a very nice look for game. 

It’s also a pretty good improvement from the original game, which is also to be expected. The character models are a lot more detailed, I’ll try and put up some pictures so you guys can see, but each character’s models is really nicely done, and looks a lot more like the show than they did in the original. Animations are very clean too, and the characters you play also have idle animations which I thought was pretty cool. 

So very nice visuals on the whole, didn’t have issues such as texture popping or blurry textures, everything looked really nice, and the colours were really pleasing. 

SOUND & MUSIC

Alright, music! Well, like a lot of other aspects of this game, the game’s music is really what you would expect from it. Obligatory, the Spongebob theme song is in the game, but other than that you have your typical Spongebob music, with the hawaiian ish guitar usually leading. This is usually the case for the game’s hub, Bikini Bottom, but each area has got its little soundtrack too. 

As for sound, it’s very cartoon ish, as you might expect. For example, a spring noise for jumping, the boing noise, the slap noise for attacking, things like that. 

Regarding sound and music, I don’t have much else to say. The game’s sound design is on the whole pretty good, nothing spectacular of course, but definitely nice to listen to. 

FINAL THOUGHTS & OPINION

Well, this was a relatively short review I’d say, and I know I’ve said this a few times already, but this game is exactly what you would expect from a Spongebob game. I saw a lot of people hating on the game for being dumb and whatever, but like, that’s exactly what Spongebob is. 

So just keep this in mind when buying the game, it is mostly aimed at people who like Spongebob, and well, naturally, it’s gonna have Spongebob things, such as silly humour, dum dum characters and a ridiculously absurd story. 

However, I don’t wanna gatekeep this game, and I do think that if you’re into platforming games and just want a relaxing, chill time, then this game might be for you. It can actually get somewhat challenging at times, if you’ve watched my let’s play you’ll know I actually died a few times, and I can’t tell if that’s embarrassing or not. 

Again, keep in mind this is a spongebob game, and it’s exactly what you would expect from a spongebob game, pure silliness and simple fun. If you can’t accept that, you’ll get annoyed very easily. 
Overall, very fun and chill game, and a great improvement over the original game, mostly on the visual side of things. 

That’s gonna be it for my review, I hope it wasn’t too short, but really there’s only so much I can talk about concerning this game, and I feel like I’ve said what I needed to. Again, remember it’s a spongebob game, not some full blown action rpg with amazing mechanics.",90

You get some light platform puzzles to solve and then you get some really fun combat with enjoyable and easy to execute combos. 
Surfing around the open-world on your shield is a very satisfying feeling and it's a great way to get around quickly. I love the graphics, they're very pleasing and voiceover with the story funny.

For gameplay & fun: youtube.com/watch?v=Fzw_y41ONLk

I only have one little nit-pick and it is I don't think the player should have to hit chests multiple times for it to open - they should just open.

I'd say you should play this game in between finishing Spyro or Super Lucky's Tale and before you start any Zelda game.

Effie is inspired by games like:
Ratchet and Clank
A Hat in Time
The Legend of Zelda - Saga
RiME
Abzu
Yooka-Laylee
Rayman - Saga
Spyro
Crash Bandicoot",100

Le tout est de savoir jusqu’où on est prêt à aller pour sacrifier sa famille, et comment aider son peuple, en choisissant minutieusement ces réponses et l’aide apporté dans telle ou telle situation ! Cependant, le gameplay ce montre vraiment très répétitif, et le scénario souffre d’énorme lenteur. La plupart du temps, il faudra simplement décider si l’on accorde de la nourriture, de l’or, ou si l’on envoi un personnage (chasseur, sorcière ou général) porter l’aide nécessaire à une situation précise. Le titre se montre rejouable pour essayer d’avoir pourquoi pas, la fin la plus heureuse possible (de mon côté, ce n’était pas la joie !), mais le fait que le jeu soit redondant n’aiderai guère à faire ce choix ! En parlant de choix d’ailleurs, ceux-ci impact la fin, mais j’ai trouvé cela parfois vraiment abracadabrantesque !!!

J’ai particulièrement accroché sur la plus jeune des filles du roi, la petite Cedani, adorable et rigolote à souhait. Elle apporte un peu de guettée et de joie dans cette bien sombre et triste histoire. 

La musique du menu est vraiment excellente. Les personnages ne parlent pas mais émettent des « bruits » sous-titré. Graphiquement parlant, les développeurs ont choisi le pixel art, un choix selon-moi judicieux pour ce jeu.",60

Don´t trust stupid rantings giving it bad score. due to problems in a console, something ramdom.
The game itself is what you have to adress, not the xbox live service.
Purchased for steam. Lots of hours playing, the game is a masterpiece. Specially for people of the 80s and 90s, that play everything except nowadays trash like fifa, fornite or call of duty, AIDS for gaming.
The graphics are awesowe, the game would.t be a hit with pixel art. Anyway you have the starring charactters handrawed, and the versions of Sor 1,2 and 3 in pixel art so no excuses.
The music is in the line of the saga, epic, brutal, a monster! Also you have the option to use old bgm of Sor 1 and 2, again no complains.
The game uses a new feature of combos, and is the base to understand the new mechanics. 
The levels are very different and long enough, we have 12 levels. 
The difficulty is a bit harder thatn previous games, with peaks of really easy to really hard (playing in normal). So if you don´t want to be slaughtered, I recommend you to start in easy, to understand the new enemies, mechanics and combos, and after the first completed game, go for normal.
A dream made true to all fans of this awesowe saga, 26 years waiting for it and it deserves the long wait.

I've spent the last days grinding and looting around to build some sort of base and storage. During one of my usual drives to a Milbase, my game had a brutal CTD that I have never experienced before (Excess of memory usage I suppose). I came back on a couple minutes later, just to find out that my Survivor had died, my car had despawned and my stuff, including the base, had disappeared.

You are tasked with having to manage and take care of all the crimes that go on in the town. Nice concept, right? But does it live up to it?

Good Cop, Bad Cop
The cops in this game, have a mind of their own. If you are not nice to them then way you need them to pull through for you and maybe work overtime they won’t. And this is where the management aspect of the game comes in. Sometimes at the start of the game when the cops come to you with requests for a day off, or fewer working hours it’s good if you are able to give them that and keep them happy because later on when you have a barrage of 911 calls coming in, they will have your back and come through for you. But if you are a jerk and just make them work overtime from day 1 then expect them to leave you stranded when you need them the most. 

The game also checks your ability to weed out the bad cops. Some of the cops you get are just rotten apples. All they will ask for is time off and not really put in any effort. If you are unable to pick them out from the rest, then you will have a hard time at this game. But this is a fun mechanic as this game is primarily a management game.

Riot at a restaurant or just a long line?
Sometimes the game throws curve balls at you. For example, you will get a call about a riot in a public place but it will just be a large crowd waiting outside. You will have to be able to pick up on these small signs that tell you whether a 911 call is an actual emergency or a prank call. While this isn’t really that important at the beginning, later o, when you are getting call after call and can’t risk sending out officers for prank calls you better be ready. This is also taken to an extreme sometimes and breaks immersion. Some of the calls you get are just so unrealistic that it brings you back to reality that this is just a game. This is a small issue I have with this game, but it can be deal breaking for more hardcore players.

Same as the first game?
Well, not really. While it has the same systems, it also builds on those systems and improves them significantly. It also adds this new turn-based combat system that shows up randomly and only in specific firefight situations. And considering the price is quite low for this game I would say that they have done enough to warrant making a sequel.

Worth it or not?
In my opinion this game is definitely worth it. While it is quite a niche game, it also makes it welcome to newer players to the genre. This is a fun, little game that is also cheap. In my opinion the price fits the value offered and even though the game has a couple of negatives I have no issue recommending this fun game.

While there are many impressive battles, the game is suffering from lots of bugs and poor optimization.
Ten years ago, Kingdom Under Fire 2 was first confirmed to release by the Korean developer “Blueside.” You would be amazed to know, at that time, the game has gone through many regional soft releases that seemed the game was running in early access with micro-transactions. However, with the help of the publisher, known as Gameforge, Kingdom Under Fire 2 has been revised for a western market. This time, the developer introduces Buy-to-play model and lets you experience the large-scale Massively Multiplayer Online progression system the game provided, while there are several impressive fierce battles. Despite outstanding gaming experience, the game is suffering from various bugs that cause weak localization and optimization.

Massively Multiplayer Online Meets Real-time Strategy
Undoubtedly, Kingdom Under Fire 2 has a winning formula, and with this game, you will get the traditional Korean MMO-style gameplay and improved mechanics, including Flashy Battle, Open World Quests, Unique Character Classes, and unbelievable Combos to master. Outside the core gameplay, the questing section, you can recruit troops and command them in vicious battlefield against other players to conquer the world, similar to other RTS games.
The perfect blend of RTS, Action, and MMO genres is offering outstanding gameplay and lets you reveal your skills to impress your friends. While playing the game, you can taste the flavors of all genres offered by this Korean game.

Introduction of MMO Genre in KUF2
Like other MMOs, you should make your focus on gaining levels and earning XP points. There are five unique playable heroes available, and you can choose one of them to start completing the thrilling missions while struggling to unravel the unforgettable storyline. The introduction of crafting system lets you craft gear and train up your powerful army to defeat opposing forces.

Introduction of RTS Genre in KUF2
Similar to other RTS games, the strategy goes matter, and it is the key to success. To win the game, you need to master all tactics and win victories. Your epic unit is standing behind you like a strong wall and always ready to defend you against evil forces. The game allows you to control a colossal of war machines and try to conquer the battlefields of Bersia in epic encounters.

Familiar Progression Systems
If you’ve played any Korean games, then you will be familiar with the progression systems of this game. During the game, you will make fractions of materials from quite challenging missions and can use to unlock upgrades and commanding troops. Each kind of army needs a set of different stuff, and you will have to upgrade the abilities of each force individually, as well as tiers.

Unique Abilities and Gears
Your selected character has unique abilities that will appear throughout first 20 levels, and you can spend points to upgrade the personality of your avatar. Throughout the game, gear will be dropped from missions and quests that you can obtain and equip to boost your power for progression and to build your armies.

Final Verdict
With the introduction of MMORTS genre and Progression systems, the game offers quite an addictive gaming experience. There’s no predatory micro-transaction model, and it is delivering real grind system for those players who love it. Despite having all cool stuff, there’re many bugs and cons too. It is offering confusing gameplay with lazy localization, and there’s a lack of diversity and femlale representation system that is poor. With lots of bugs and weak system.

Anyway the game is worth it as of right now so pick it up while there are players playing, keep in mind the game is cross-play so you will find players regardless, the community as of right now is very active, if you are interested in online PvP fun then purchase the Champions Edition and jump right in, if you want to play on couch with friends its also a great deal.

It was released for Microsoft Windows on March 23, 2020, supporting all SteamVR-compatible headsets like Valve Index, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Oculus Quest, and all Windows Mixed Reality headsets.

Gameplay:
While all the Half-life fans have been anticipating for Half-Life 3 release for over 13 years now, Valve & Gabe Newell didn't wholly disappoint them with Half-life Alyx with the series' return in a knockout VR (Virtual Reality) experience. The game comes free if you purchased Valve's own VR hardware line - Valve Index.
The tale of HLA follows the footsteps of Alyx five years before the events of Half-life 2 in which Gordon freeman wakes up from his mysterious stasis to find Earth colonized by aliens called the Combine. Alyx, the protagonist, daughter of Eli Vance, is stuck performing surveillance and recon for the anti-Combine resistance in City 17. The city is the same washed-out and decaying Eastern European metropolis as you visit in Half-life 2. It is immediately engaging to be back in City 17 again because it offers the unparalleled impression of VR. The initial moments are breathtaking & leave you dumb folded watching the scenery, striders pass by, and the city scanner is blinding you with the camera flash. The attention to details is far more incredible right-on as you can grab, hold, throw, interact with any sort of objects, using Alyx's virtual fingers and your controller. You can even pick up a marker to scrawl something on the dirty windowpane, and then use an eraser to wipe it off! And seeing Combine soldiers and Zombies in life-size is a different experience altogether. 
Later on, both Eli and Alyx are captured, but a fellow Resistance member Russell manages to rescue Alyx, warning her that the Combine will transport Eli to Nova Prospekt for interrogation. After that, Alyx ventures into the Quarantine Zone outside City 17 to save his father with gravity gloves (similar to the gravity gun) to aid her mission. These gloves can manipulate gravity and help her to move objects on a flick of your wrists and grab them mid-air alongside with a remote device to hack into electrical systems and a handgun for starters. While exploring, you'll come across various enemies, including Barnacles, Manhacks, Headcrabs, zombies, Combine soldiers, and many others. Each enemy can be killed using your three weapons - Handgun, Shotgun, and SMG, there are also grenades. The game also features upgrades like Reflex/Laser sights, extended mag, Burst fire, etc. by finding a resource item called 'Resin,' which can be used at upgrade stations. Healing items include small injection doses that can restore half a health while finding an alien grub in a glass cylinder can be used on wall-mounted health stations to restore it fully.

Combat: 
Gun battles are particularly simple in HLA. You have to physically mimic to reload your handgun, shotgun & SMG realistically like IRL. Against Zombies and Headcrabs, its often just aim and shoot, but when facing the Combine, you'll need to take some cover and manage your bullets sharply as each one takes at least 9-10 shots before dying. It's satisfying & enjoyable for a while but sometimes gets too repetitive as enemies aren't as aggressive as other HL games. Headcrabs are slow and predictable and rarely hit you accurately, while you fire at Combines, they stand idly taking damage, do not take any cover, or run away from grenades. Also, there is no melee combat in the game, which is ironic to the HL franchise since you carried around a crowbar as Gordon at all times.

Graphics: 
The game runs excellently smooth, provided you meet the recommended specifications for the game. The game runs best on the Valve Index as it is particularly optimized for the same. As for In-game graphics, they are surreal with breathtaking detailing and contrasting from cramped spaces, broken apartments, with alien goo covered floor & walls and excellent lightning effects. The game also packed with many easter eggs (if you manage to find them!)

Conclusion: 
Overall, If Valve reimagines the Half-life's Future in VR, then they will disappoint many PC gamers who loved the original First-person Half-life experience. While not getting our hopes high for Half-life 3, I must say Alyx serves as the perfect mediator between HL1 & 2. HLA isn't getting any non-VR mod officially so if you have the suitable hardware, this is a must-buy for VR enthusiasts and the best 13+ hours of gameplay you'll relive in Half-life universe. I can't recommend it enough!",90

Score: 7/10
Mediocrity Score - Not Mediocre.
It's hard to get me to like most strategy games, and I really enjoyed this one. I had to knock it down a whole point due to the lack of available servers & players online.

Tags: A few words or tags that come to mind after playing are: tactical, ""just one more turn"", RPG-esque, time-consuming.

Avg. Time to beat: 25 hours
Quickest Speedrun: 8 hours

Quick Take: Six years after its original release, Age of Wonders III still stands as a remarkably competent and fun 4x turn-based strategy and tactical combat game. Triumph Studios two-games-in-one approach sets Age of Wonders III in a rare cross-genre we only see come out of the Total War franchise. It's immensely exciting and fun at the onset, but it does begin to drag on and show it's repetitiveness after 20-40 hours. If you're already a fan of this style game, you could very easily double or triple that number. Unfortunately, the multiplayer is almost entirely dead. Singleplayer or LAN games would be your only viable options. If you've not played this wonder of a game - I'd recommend you give this one a shot. It has a lot to offer, particularly in it's tactical combat battles. Plus - I've seen this title go on sale for as low as $7.50. That's a bargain for a game that you will easily put 30+ hours into playing.

Concept: It's rare we get the genres of a tactical combat game blended with a 4x strategy game. They've really pulled it off on this one and that alone makes it worth checking out. The challenge keeps the game fun and interesting, while also feeling very achievable.

Graphics: Beautiful game. Still looks very fresh and lush having been 6 years since it was released. Combat scenes are impressively detailed and varied for something most developers would have done less with. That sort of attention to detail is not common enough.

Sound: Music is fine, but for a game that spans such a long amount of time - I found myself muting it within the first 8 hours of gameplay. Voice acting, however, is great - even if only included in the two campaigns.

Playability: Tutorial does a poor job, mostly relying on an in-game encyclopedia appropriately called the Tome of Wonders. The game itself is easy enough to get the hang of, but learning effective strategies for the many different scenarios is a challenge but one that brings you back for more. Some campaign goals could be better communicated.

Entertainment: I wish the city-building component was more fulfilling, but as a whole, the game really does an awesome job of creating an atmosphere that draws you in wanting ""just one more turn"". Combat is where the game shines the most providing a large array of options to destroy your enemies and competition.

Replay: High. You can create your own heroes, your own scenarios, partake in online play (which is very limited in 2020), and make good use of the modding community. This all breathes more life into a game that already is very replayable.

Cheats?: Yes! An adequate amount of cheats are available using the in-game console. No trainers or file modifications needed. To enable, withing game launcher's check the checkbox for ""Run in Debug Mode"" before starting the game. Once in a campaign or match - use CTRL+ALT+C to bring up the console.

Six years after its original release, Age of Wonders III still stands as a remarkably competent and fun 4x turn-based strategy and tactical combat game. Triumph Studios two-games-in-one approach sets Age of Wonders III in a rare cross-genre we only see come out of the Total War franchise. Age of Wonders III introduces a new form of combat - turn-based tactical battles. Taking place in an entirely different view and space from the over-head strategy map view. This two-in-one game change has brought mixed reviews from super-fans of the original two games in the series. The tired and uninspired campaign story is saved by the quality of the voice-overs as well as the lush, beautiful graphics throughout the entire game. The tactical combat battles are an exceptional example of the amount of detail the design team has put into the game.

The incredibly long matches that are standard-fare for 4x turn-based strategy games is still alive and well within Age of Wonders III, earning it the ""just one more turn"" achievement. Expect entire matches or campaigns to last several hours. Age of Wonders shines the brightest within the tactical battles; in part due to the variety of enemy units, monsters scattered throughout, and especially the sheer volume of different attacks, spells and approaches one must take to succeed. The racial choices you pick do feel very ""samesy"" in that while very different looking - they all have the same function within their unit type.

An additional highlight of the tactical battles is the vast amount of terrain-based scenery changes that spice up the battlefield. Along with treasure sites, subterranean spaces, and overlays - the scenery can mean a morale boost or morale penalty might be levied upon your units depending on the racial mix. Even further, treasure sites employ a higher difficulty due to the battlefield conditions causing curses, negative trait enchantments, or boosts to the enemy units. The primary players on the battlefield are the heroes, which function as the main combat leaders having an array of spells at their disposal. Only being able to use one spell a turn within combat, this helps balance and prevent hero-stacking your unit fleets - which is very important if you play multiplayer modes. Furthermore, Age of Wonders III provides an RPG-esque aspect by having each hero gain level-ups which provide ability points that can be assigned to provide a more powerful hero and units. Heroes also have an inventory where they can stash equipment found throughout the game - all of which can also be equipped to further enhance your capabilities in the battlefield.

The most glaring technical fault within the game spurs from the simultaneous turns option. Unit movement, ending turns, and simple clicks within the game can become 20-second delays which make the player question if the game has frozen or is crashing. The further you get into a campaign or match, the more painful the delays become as your unit count and city count are presumably at their highest.

I'll admit, I always do research, partake in discussions, and even check out many other reviews or opinions before I write a review. This isn't to make my job easier to parrot the same things others have already said, but rather argue against points others have stated that I disagree with. Many, many critics and players have complained about the instant-fail conditions during the campaign. Let's consider two things:
1. This is a single-player, story-driven campaign. If the main protagonist dies or the city he/she is trying to protect is conquered well then OF COURSE you lose. Any other game would be the same. Your main character dies? Game over.
2. You also get to save and reload at any point within the campaign, scenarios, local multiplayer, and even online (albeit a bit different of a loading process). There's no room for acting like this is some sort of hardcore mode where you lose in a campaign = starting all over from scratch (like many other games would have you do). You can just load from a saved game!

For these reasons, I feel these complaints are both off-base and unfair, as well as invalid. But, everyone is allowed their opinion. I simply disagree with those arguments 100%.

The game is mostly divided into stealth campaign, which tries to resemble ""reality"" and the brutality (hostage situations, special force raids, etc.). Then you also have the famous Rambo style type of shooting.

Anyway I finally fixed the freezing issue, or at least most of them. There will be usually a little freeze before performance demanding scenes like explosions.

This game has everything good about the first game plus even more interesting game elements. The biggest addition is the naval combat, which is there in spades. This game is like most other CRPGs where game offers you a chance to make the character you wish and level them up as they progress through the story as well as recruiting allies and teammates.

*Find Yourself!*
This game offers you a chance to create any character you wish. You can make them look however you wish in terms of appearance. You can choose from a variety of classes, you can be a druid or a mage, a wizard or a warrior the choice is wide and it is yours. You can also dual class and be a mix of different classes, for example you can be a battle-mage, a character who is focused on battling with a bit of magic to maybe buff yourself and allies. One thing the game does better than most other games in the genre is that it offers you a LOT of choices, as you level up in terms of new skills and abilities. The game also lets you choose to continue from your save in the first game, if you have played it. You basically take your character and a few decisions from the first game carry over. But fear not, if you haven’t played and are missing out on the story because this game does a good job of catching you up with the events of the previous game. Others have said that not playing the first one didn’t create a huge difference or gaps in story, but they wish that they have had played it, as it is also a great game.

*Best Combat in the Genre?*
I am a huge fan of this genre and out of all the games I must say this is the one. This is a huge compliment because a lot of games don’t do combat right in this genre. This game has real time combat with the ability to pause it. You can also have the AI to control your allies, although as you play more of the game I suggest you take control of them yourself for more precise decisions. This is something that the other games also have, but there is a certain way that combat has been balanced in PoE 2 that it makes everything feel just right without being too difficult to learn. Don’t get me wrong there is a learning curve for the hardcore fans, but the skill floor is quite low to accommodate for newer players of the genre.

*Ship Combat: Good or Bad?*
The answer to that question is - actually both. The naval combat in this game is good but can also be bad at times and that is the only negative thing I have to say about the game. The ship combat initially is quite dull compared to the rest of the game as it takes form in a text-based format. It makes the game feel like the text-based games from 30 years ago but with a lot of RNG. Although there are some elements that are good about it. There are several roles on the ship and you need the right people in the right role to do those jobs. If you have a surgeon firing the canons, then don’t expect to be hitting a lot of the shots. There is also boarding and that is the highlight of the naval combat. The combat scenarios that come up when you are boarding a ship or being boarded yourself are definitely one of the most fun times in this game. I don’t know why exactly but I guess it might be that it is very close quarters combat in a game like this doesn’t happen often.

*Hours and Hours of Content*
This game is definitely worth picking up and it even does a good job of easing newer players into the genre. It has hundreds of hours worth of content and that is just on a single playthrough. This game offers a tonne of re-playability with the option of multiple character with different playstyles.

------------------------------------------------------

Attention, je ne viens pas cracher sur ce jeu, encore moins sur la licence, son ambiance, sa mécanique ou son orientation.
J'évoque mon ressenti sur un rapport qualité-prix, et, forcément, je compare. J'ai commencé à jouer en 1990.

Tu ne peux pas demander autant d'argent (même la version de base à 36€ un an après la sortie) pour un produit aussi léger.
Pense qu'un ""Final Fantasy"", un ""Tales of..."", n'est jamais aussi cher, et pourtant la qualité te saute aux yeux, que ce soit techniquement, artistiquement ou au niveau du système de jeu, ou même des DLC (exemple : ""Berseria"").

Je n'ai touché à Ryza qu'une bonne heure, mais ce que j'ai vu, entendu et palpé, me semble très très en dessous du prix exigé.
Koei-Tecmo, qui je le rappelle, sont connus pour leurs prix exorbitants et leurs DLC à date de péremption, va vous la mettre comme il faut, ou plutôt ""komifo"", comme on dit à Vierzon.

On commence ?
*craquements de doigts*

=> Cinématique d'intro et suivantes inintéressantes : c'est l'été, on se fait ch*er, y'a rien à faire au village, si on allait voir le nouveau marchand qui vient d'arriver ? Pas trop le temps de présenter les persos, on y va.

=> Allers-retours en suivant l'icône de la map, sans cesse. Si tu veux aller voir ailleurs, on te rappelle à l'ordre. C'est pas par là, voyons.

=> Murs invisibles (j'adore)

=> Saut complètement WTF (il faut la voir sauter, pour le croire, indescriptible : elle est comme poussée en avant par un coup de vent mou, avec un bruitage Swhhh juste inacceptable, surtout en combo avec un mur invisible).

=> Textures très variables, un côté Playstation 2 ou 3 par moments (particulièrement le sol et les arrière-plans)

=> Les PNJS croisés n'ont pas souvent quelque chose à dire, ils disparaissent même si on s'approche trop près -!-

=> Animations très sommaires, surtout lors des dialogues (vaut mieux ne pas regarder les bouches...)

=> Les personnages sont partiellement animés, vous verrez certaines parties du corps (par exemple les 2 mèches qui pendent et les deux seins qui boiiing-boiiiing, sur Ryza) mais le reste est totalement immobile, figé. Les persos ne sont pas très bien intégrés aux décors non plus. Le character design fait passer ""Dragon Quest XI"", ""Tales of ce-que-tu-veux"" et même ""Final Fantasy X"" pour des chefs d'oeuvre dignes du Louvre.

=> Prends ta dose d'aliasing sur l'herbe, c'est offert (aucune option ne permet de le vaincre)

=> Proportions très spéciales : la caméra se fixe bien juste sous les fesses de Ryza, mais il ne faut pas demander à regarder trop haut, trop bas, y'a pas, et en combat, le postérieur de notre charmante villageoise est carrément devant le caméra, on a limite envie de lui demander de se pousser.

=> Doublage japonais correct, sous-titres EN PLEIN MILIEU DE L'ECRAN (on a jamais vu ça nulle part)

=> Ryza est certes une villageoise très avenante, parce qu'elle a deux gros arguments qui se balancent quand elle court, mais elle est escortée par un grand dadais bien niais et un corniaud qui a un look de victime de harcèlement scolaire. Pas très dur de briller au milieu des déchets. Je sais bien qu'on est censés s'attacher à la bande, qui s'agrandit par la suite, mais très honnêtement ils n'ont rien à dire d'intéressant. Mettez côte-à-côte la première heure sur ""Final Fantasy XIII"" et celle de Ryza. Que constatez-vous ? sans commentaire.

=> Les combats sont mous du genou, commencent par un bon gros blur, se terminent sur un bon vieux flash blanc (imaginez pendant 100h), et lorsqu'on attend son tour, à part reluquer les fesses de Ryza... remarque, oui, je comprends... mais... donne moi quelque chose à faire quand même.

Vous l'aurez compris, pour moi c'est refund / remboursement, et je ne suis pas sûr de pouvoir me faire rembourser les DLCs honteux que j'ai ajoutés à mes frais du jour.

Bien sûr, l'alchimie a l'air sympa, les combats semblaient prometteurs, et l'enrobage tout mignonnet, sur une aventure d'été avec des gros seins, c'est sûrement agréable, je ne dis pas le contraire.

Mais f*ck Koei-Tecmo, ses prix délirants, et sa finition risible.

This is by far the best ag racing game for the PC. Yes, there are some bugs (a few of them only) which I'm sure the devs will take care of. There might be some minor corrections needed but it's still a high quality game! If you like AG racing and you haven't bought it already, then do it.

Really loved the character customization. Literally spent an hour at first making my perfect protagonist.
Wasn't too short of a game. Clocked in about 34 h in my first playthrough.
After a month or so of the release I was kinda shocked, because there were quite a few mods where you can put a dck'n'balls on the character...yea
The combat was definitely more focused on then the story, but it was still amazing, even giving us multiple endings.

On the flip side, if you are not intrigued by the trailer(s), this is most likely not a game for you. Yet whilst the shots in the promotional videos are essentially the core game, Mutazione as a whole is far greater than the sum of its parts, much in the same manner as Night in the Woods, a game I’d previously thought to be unique in its genre-defying diversity. With that in mind, I feel the best way to attempt to encapsulate what this game has to offer is by comparing the two. Even if you haven’t played NITW (I’d wholeheartedly recommend it), I’d hope this review is still of use to you :).

• Premise
Mutazione and, in turn, Night in the Woods are 2D side-scrolling ‘adventures’, set in run-down locations that hold great meaning to their communities. They also occur over a fictional timespan of 1 to 2 weeks, with the MC settling into a daily routine of waking up, moving through ‘zones’ in which you can engage with each character in their usual habitat, alongside one or two scheduled interactions before heading back to bed, where on some days you experience dreams relating to the underlying mysteries of the place. Though Mutazione takes place over a shorter number of days, its division of time means there is more to do per day. These games can be completed in around 5 hours, but the process of exploring and conversing with all the NPCs took my first play-through of both around 15-20 hours (admittedly, judging from other reviews, I am an abnormally slow gamer :D).

• Narrative
Both games have subtle supernatural and mental health undertones, but these are largely set aside in their first acts. Ultimately, I find the plot and foreshadowing of its conclusion are more consistent throughout, and probably superior, in Mutazione.

• Writing
That each game doesn’t indulge in considerable storytelling in the first few days, though, is perhaps what makes me so invested in them, as they dedicate plenty of time to building the most believable, three dimensional characters (figuratively if not literally)- more so than any other games I’ve experienced. Whilst the peculiarity and design of this hodgepodge congregation of Mutazione's outcasts matches that of Possum Spring's equally peculiar anthropomorphs, the charm and humour fall short in comparison. Giving the player vague dialogue options such as ‘make a joke’ or ‘be sincere’ (the likes of which Mutazione does on occasion) rather than previewing the full text of each alternative is also to its detriment, and can dampen what may have been an otherwise amusing line.

• Art Style
The pair of games feature gorgeous drawn and animated settings, split up into the aforementioned zones. The detail and creativity in setting design are even stronger in Mutazione in my opinion (see some of my screenshots). It also possesses a more vibrant colour palette, and the 2.5D nature of these landscapes (similar to those in Oxenfree) helps to flesh out the environment. Although NITW makes its location of Possum Springs seem more ‘inhabited’ with plenty of extras and animals, Mutazione somewhat makes up for this with the teeming flora on the island, all of which you can find details of in your plant encyclopaedia.

• Gameplay
The gameplay/mini-game elements that are slotted in are the weakest components of the respective titles and add very little to the game (excluding the gem that is Demontower in NITW). Though the gardening aspect of Mutazione is sometimes a peaceful interlude and does fit seamlessly with the style and flow of the game, it can become tiresome by the end and I doubt I will be visiting the additional ‘Garden Mode’. I personally don’t think a game should have to justify that it is one by forcing traditional gameplay mechanics in; the act of taking the player on a journey at their own pace makes a game a game for me, and the strength of the narrative often directly corresponds with my appreciation and rating of it as a whole. This is certainly true for Mutazione. Just as anybody who may go into NITW expecting a platformer- after reading some dubious reviews- would be misled, someone anticipating a planting/harvesting sim (though I can’t understand that appeal myself) would be disappointed with Mutazione.

• Soundtrack
The two games feature strong soundtracks, but the sheer range from sombre to mellow to jaunty depending on the location and time, along with a healthy sprinkling of Allesandro Coronas’ cultural influence, elevates Mutazione’s ambience to one of the best, for me.

TL;DR
A game centred around character relationships and exploration, most similar comparison being Night in the Woods. A beautiful experience I’d recommend to almost everyone, the exception being those who prefer an abundance of gameplay or lack the patience for a more slow-moving game (their loss if you ask me).",80

En effet, le jeu se veut orienté compétitif simple à prendre en main, et rien de tel que pour s'amuser avec des amis.

Le multijoueur local est disponible jusqu'à 8 joueurs, en tour par tour. Le ""manque"" de map disponible est rapidement comblée par les créations des autres joueurs, disponible dans le Workshop de Steam. Cependant, il ne faut pas oublier, où à l'heure dont j'écrit cette review, le jeu est encore en accès anticipé ; ce qui nous offre un avant goût d'un jeu à fort potentiel.
Un mode multijoueur est également présent, évidemment, avec des serveurs sans limite de joueur, ce qui sur le papier semble être génial, mais des manques d'optimisation se présentent à plus de 120 joueurs en simultanés. La seule chose qu'on peut reprocher à ce mode multijoueur, est le manque de joueurs tout simplement. En effet, le jeu reste encore peu connu aux yeux du grand public.

L'éditeur est bien fourni, et permet de créer de nombreux contenu (et même avec ses amis en synchro !), permettant de personnaliser le jeu à son goût. Rien à dire sur cet éditeur que j'apprécie fortement, malgré la prise en main de ce dernier peu expliquée (il faut aller les chercher soit-même les aides dans le menu) ce qui la rend complexe pour les moins habitués.

Je suis un Gamer qui aiment les jeux inédit et originaux mais avec la notion du héros qui se pointe et règle un problème de dingue. Donc pour ce jeu, je l'ai analysé avant de l'acheter, car je voulais savoir ce qu'il avait dans le game.

Pour ceux qui veulent une réponse très rapide et générale : c'est un bon petit jeu qui va vous changer les idées.
Il s'agit d'un FPS qui cache un aspect lien d'amitié et question-réponse assez marrant avec les personnages jouables qu'il faut convaincre et avoir dans sa petite équipe.
C'est un petit jeu mélangeant FPS, Run, gestion de vie des perso et des capacités.

Pour les plus courageux, qui veulent en savoir plus sans spoiler :
Le thème est très actuel : famille, écologique, complot intergalactique.
Les liens entre les persos dans ce jeu sont importants et utile pour certains moments de l'histoire.
Niveau graphisme, c'est un genre proche des animés, du coup cela change des graphismes recherchant à tout prix, le virtuel et le réalisme à tout prix, c'est une bouffée d'oxygène.
C'est un petit jeu simple et sympa qui permet de penser différemment pour les phases combats : il ne faut pas être bourrin mais réfléchir par de la stratégie et de l'action.
Niveau stage : ils sont répartis en secteur les plus populaires d'une planète : désert, glace, foret, tropical, et les donjons ou souterrains qui sont créés aléatoirement suivant votre arrivée. (rien de compliqué)
Ce jeu est sympa à parcourir pour réaliser un 100 %, moi en presque 8 h, j'ai développé 75 % du jeu tranquillement.

En définitif, AWAY mérite d'être plus développé en termes de niveau et de pousser le concept du héros n'ayant aucun pouvoir sans ses amis, plus loin. Cependant, la simplicité de ce jeu peut déplaire, par son graphisme ou par des joueurs n'ayant pas compris le concept de ce jeu, qui je le rappelle n'a pas beaucoup de jeu qui ont emprunté cette vision du partage de capacité (on pourrait penser à Pokémon, mais AWAY reste un FPS et on est loin de la gestion des évolutions des compétences)
Dans l'histoire d'AWAY, on doit juste se faire des amis et pas forcément chercher le combat à tous moments.

Voilà, j'ai bien aimé ce jeu même s’il est simple, petite durée de gaming, pas dans l'extraordinaire mais assez fun pour passer un bon moment.
Je demande au développeur de nous créer un second AWAY avec plus d'histoires, de défis originaux et plus de personnages jouables. L'idée principale est à garder : sans l'amitié tout chemin reste compliqué.",70

Les paysages miniatures sont peints à la main, éclairés de différentes façons pour simuler différentes heures de la journée et même redécorés pour imiter différentes saisons, un travail impressionnant à la hauteur de films d’animations comme Wallace et Gromit, Chicken Run. Une fois terminés, les décors sont digitalisés à l’aide d’une technique appelée photogrammétrie, et mélangés avec les personnages et des effets visuels. vant de commencer à jouer à Trüberbrook, je n’avais aucune idée de l’aventure palpitante que j’allais vivre à travers ce point-and-click. J’étais très attiré par le rendu graphique et par ce type de jeu auquel je ne m’étais plus essayé depuis Monkey Island et Grim Fandango, mais je ne m’attendais pas à être autant envouté par ce scénario montant crescendo jusqu’à une conclusion épique.

En lo referente a la historia, desde luego es un JRPG clásico, de los que utilizaban la trama como una excusa para justificar el juego en si. En este caso, la historia es un trámite para ambientar la aventura con su entretenido sistema de combate y el bonito apartado visual que ofrece el juego.

It is an action-adventure, open world RPG by the renowned Polish studio CD Projekt Red. As you may have guessed by now, you play as a Witcher, a monster hunter capable of superhuman strength and reflexes having undergone mutations. Our protagonist Geralt is on a journey to find his adopted daughter Ciri, who has been missing for years. He must reach her before the Wild Hunt, a group of ethereal warriors trying to find her for her secret powers. Geralt is aided by a wide cast of friends and acquaintances including Yennefer and Triss, his lovers at points in life, Dandelion and Zoltan. The game has adult themes and requires a certain level of maturity to truly appreciate the intricately woven stories.

The game has many positives that it would be impossible to list them all but I shall try to shortlist the most remarkable ones. To start off, the game is set in a gorgeous world, that you are free to explore, that feels truly alive. From the icy mountains of Ard Skellige to the marshes of Velgen to the City of Novigrad, the different areas in the game have a distinct feel with their own culture and atmosphere. The devs have shown a lot of attention to the tiniest of details to make the world feel real. If you block a pedestrian’s way for too long; they get annoyed. It starts raining, and you see people run for some cover. You can even hear people sneezing and someone else shouting “bless you” at them. There are also tons of easter eggs for you to find in this massive world. You can find a prison akin to the one that contained Tyrion Lannister in the Game of Thrones series. Fan of Doctor Who? Well, you can find the Weeping Angels statues in the game, where they actually move each time you turn around! As for graphical fidelity, even 3 years after release, the game looks as good, if not better, than most AAA games that came out this year. Now that’s everything about the eye candies in the game. 

What can you actually do in the world? Well, A LOT! There are several quests, both main story and side quest. The care taken to craft even smallest of the side quests can be felt. You may even end up confusing side quests with main quests due to their depth and how some of them tie up with the main story. Each quest will give you several ways to tackle them and can even have several endings. which may end up impacting the final ending as well. You can also take up witcher contracts from notice boards to slay different kinds of monsters plaguing the villagers. And if you ever feel tired from the adventures, you can just roam around the game world challenging bar owners and shopkeepers to a game of Gwent, a card game that is now a standalone game of its own. If you take your time and try to finish as many quests as possible, then you will easily have 100+ hours of content in front of you. Even if you choose to rush through the game, you will have 50+hours to enjoy here. The skill tree also allows for different playstyles, depending on which skills you decide to buy and equip. You can invest your points into combat, magic or alchemy, with each offering a slightly different playstyle. These skills can further be enhanced by various mutagens. In the Blood and Wine expansion, you can also develop mutations that grant you further customization options. All in all, the variety of quests and skills allow you to play through the game differently giving it a fair degree of replayability. 

So what about the negatives? Well there aren’t many, and the few ones that I have are just nitpicks. The one that comes to mind is that the combat, along with movement, feels a bit clunky and lacking. You can tap the move key and Geralt will sort of lunge forward 3-5 step. This just feels heavy and not at all smooth, unlike the rest of the game. You can even get stuck because of smallest of bumps since you can’t jump during combat. This becomes a problem when fighting in closed space. Furthermore, In higher difficulties, there aren’t many combat paths that are viable; most notably, Alchemy-centric build isn’t a viable option in higher difficulties, preventing the combat from providing a true RPG experience.

Personally, I enjoyed my time with the game, but I had to keep telling myself not to look at it like a true RPG rather look at it more of an action adventure centred game. There are mods available to improve the combat, which was something that I really needed, and other quality of life changes for small nitpicks you might have. 

To sum it up, this is an amazing game, just not an amazing RPG. Go into this game not looking at the RPG tag attached to it, and you will enjoy it extensively. This game is definitely worth buying, and it will offer you a lot of quality content. The only people I would advise to be cautious are the ones that are either looking for an RPG in the style of the Divinity games, or the Elder Scrolls games, or those that want an amazing combat experience. Although, if you have issues with the latter on PC, you can always get a few mods to improve the combat.

This game is a solid 10/10.

Syndicate had good potential, too bad it is not fully used. Short single player campaign, poor storytelling, could be better. If You like Deus Ex , do not expect Syndicate to be one. It is more linear FPS in the first place.
Okay, it is not everything bad. You got aggressive AI, that keeps the pressure on, gunplay and hacking is also fun.It has very nice graphics, excellent co-op mode. 
So, if you want to play it , I recommend co op, much more fun than go single player.

Also, because it is very cheap on this site (on Origin sale it is not under 10€), you do not get feeling that you are ripped off.
I must mention, if You buy this game, probably you will need to contact Origin support, because of activation. Do not worry,problem is in Origin. I had problems with other games for Origin(Crysis, which I bought in retail,wouldn`t activate).",70

I'm not exaggerating, they definitely did a good job at showing how brutal and disgusting the Black Death was. However even such horrible event cannot surpass how some people were more disgusting to each other and in some cases they use the tragedy for their own benefits. The game portrays that very well.

In that horrible world we find the sister and the little brother who have that innocent and adorable bond. As the story evolves I felt so attached to Amicia, it could be the cute accent, but I think it was also how the character evolves to the point where she would risk anything just for the safety of her brother and that basically is how Amicia grew so charismatic and heroic to me.

You cannot compare this with previous Sims like 3 or 2. Even 4 yrs after release the build mode still lacks in huge amount of tools we used to have. The biggest issue l have that somehow the development team is not really able to provide matching sets in all categories. Some color choices are questionable and very limited. If you plan to stick with the basegame only you won't explore the full fun. You will need to buy DLCs to improve the gameplay. Overall l dislike a lot of things how they handled yet it captivates me and am intrigued by my simmies. I hope they will improve even though they started to recolor and adjust certain meshes which get repetitive and EA wants money for that, too but the Sim community provides million of custom content you can add and make this game your own and with DLCs you can add some gameplay.

Extinction is a Hack and Slash action game with procedurally generated worlds. You play as a hero tasked with saving humanity from...well, extinction! You have to save small pockets of civilization on each map and fight off against the bosses - giants. .

Breakdown
Attack, attack and attack!
Most of the time you will be fighting off against smaller mobs around a small group of people you are trying to save. Once you defeat the enemies in an area, you have to activate a pillar that will ensure that that group of people are saved from the monsters around. Periodically, huge giants will pop up, and you have to fight them. Basically, they are the bosses of each level. But wait, you can’t just go and hack them to death. Each giant will have pieces of armour around its legs, arms, neck, shoulders, and head. You first have to break these pieces of armour, after which you can proceed to take out said body part of the giant. As you slowly do this, you can expose more parts, and once you have exposed enough, you can strike a finishing blow on the giant.

So which map? Oh wait, it doesn’t really matter
There are a few cities you can choose from to play in, but they all are procedurally generated with minor differences. As a result, what might have been an important decision becomes an irrelevant one. This feels like a missed opportunity as they could have made each city, while being randomly generated, have its own features like different types of enemies or additional environmental elements like lava or earthquakes and such. Yet, as they are randomly generated, it does add a bit of replayability to the game which is a good thing.

Remember to fill your damage boost!
One very unique and nice mechanic is that devs have added to this game, is the boost feature. There is a “damage boost” bar next to the minimap, alongside with the health bar. As you kill more mobs and destroy more chunks of armour from the giants, this bar fills up and increases your damage. The game rewards you for playing, and the rewards encourage you to play more at the same time.

Okay, so what else?
Sadly, there isn’t anything else to do in the game which is a big shame, because it is fun to play. The game would be better with a proper progression system or co-op, but the game doesn’t have those features whatsoever.

Should you pick this up?
It’s a tough question. The game does have a bit to offer, but sometimes it feels repetitive, unless you really like melee combat; only then I would definitely say that it is worth it. You can have quite a bit of fun in this game to make it worth picking up. Also, if they add co-op at any point in the future then it would definitely be worth its price tag. In any other case, it is recommended to wait for a big price drop or a deep sale.

Campaign is actually good and there is a mission that feels close to SWAT 4, which is another level of FPS games. People who has interest in COD games will love this. The game is mostly divided into stealth campaign, which tries to resemble ""reality"" and the brutality (hostage situations, special force raids, etc.). Then you also have the famous Rambo style type of shooting.

Anyway I finally fixed the freezing issue, or at least most of them. There will be usually a little freeze before performance demanding scenes like explosions.

L'univers est très bien retranscrit, les graphismes sont plutôt bien réalisés, et les combats sont vraiment dynamiques.

Il manque quelques petites choses pour vraiment apprécier ce jeu, je trouve ( pour ma part ) qu'il manque des choses quant à la spécialisation de notre avatar ( je parle pour les jutsus ).

En effet, a la Ultimate Ninja Storm, le personnage dispose de 2 jutsus ""de base"" et d'un jutsu dit ""secret"". Sachant qu'il y'a 4 types de jeu qui sont Attaque, Distance, Défense et Soigneur. Je trouve que cela fait un peu léger, et le fait de ne jouer qu'avec ces 3 techniques rends les combats assez répétitifs, et réduit les chances de vous démarquer des autres joueurs. Encore une fois ce n'est que mon point de vue.

Le jeu est très principalement PVP. C'est la source principale d'xp, si je ne dis pas de bêtises ! Les combats se font a 4 contre 4, avec différents enjeux comme capture de base ou encore match a mort, a la call of ! A vous de créer vos synergies avec les différents membres de votre équipe.

Un système de maître assez complet, qui vous permet de choisir un mentors parmi les personnages les plus emblématiques de l'animé, qui vous apprendront leur techniques au fur et a mesure que vous gagnerez de l’expérience dans la formation qu'ils vous enseigneront. 

Notez que vous avez accès a un mode solo, qui n'est autre qu'un enchaînement de missions a faire avec votre maître, ou alors en coop,avec d'autres apprentis ninja :) C'est ce mode qui permet de déverrouiller les différents mentors au fur et a mesure que vous accomplirez es missions qui vous sont confiées.

you get to lead your own team of british soldiers into different missions behind enemy lines. while the story is close to non existant it's very easy to imagine your own story with the men you choose in every mission and if they die in a mission, they are dead for the rest of your playthough. 

the game will take you to africa, norway, france and many other location. almost every mission is different so it never feels like you're doing the same thing. in one mission you might have to infiltrate a submarine and the next one lets you help a group of american troops hold a stronghold.

overall, i highly recommend the game if you are ready for a budgety game experience",90

La mayoría de reseñas hablaban de lo bonito que es el juego, los dibujos al estilo japonés, la música...
Y había una que lo criticaba, por ser excesivamente corto, cosa que tampoco me parecía razonable.

Y ahora, tras haberlo jugado...
Ññññe

No voy a hacer spoilers, pero... el juego tiene dos finales; y tras haber visto los dos, no me parece que sea un juego de esos que te toca la fibra. Es previsible, y fin. Así que en cuanto a historia... ñññe
La música... bueno, sin más.
Y los gráficos sí que me parecen bonitos, la verdad.

El principal problema... bugs, curiosamente xD
La primera vez que me lo he intentado pasar, estaba más o menos metido en la historia, y de repente se ha quedado pillado en la conversación.
He intentado todo (que básicamente es moverse a la derecha, a la izquierda, pulsar barra espaciadora, o Esc); y nada ha servido; así que he tenido que volver a empezar, porque el juego se ha guardado automáticamente ahí.
Después, he decidido intentarlo otra vez, y he ido haciendo todos los puzzles rápido, sin pararme; y en una de las zonas, he debido de pulsar la barra espaciadora cuando no debía, y me he saltado la mitad del juego y he ido a la penúltima zona; es decir, prácticamente al final del juego. Lo malo es que he visto el final, mientras sonaba la banda sonora de la zona que se ha buggeado, lo que estropeaba la escena completamente.

He decidido volver a intentarlo, para al menos llegar a al otro final, y me ha ocurrido lo mismo: se me ha buggeado en otro sitio, he tenido que volver a empezar, y al hacerlo sin querer he vuelto a buggearlo y a saltarme la mitad del juego, llegando de nuevo a la penúltima zona.

Así que, por última vez, he decidido volver a probarlo, y me lo he pasado todo, esta vez sí. Y para cuando he llegado al final... estaba más frustrado que otra cosa.
Al menos he podido llegar rápido, me habrá llevado poco más de cinco o seis minutos.

Así que... a ver, el juego no es feo.
Es bonito, y habrá que crea que la historia es bonita (ya digo que sin más, si quieres una historia realmente bonita vete a otros juegos).
Pero yo he estado más frustrado que otra cosa.",60

Le jeu est extrêmement technique et connaître un circuit semble être la clé pour réussir avec brio et parfaitement une map afin d'obtenir le rang maximum de celle-ci.

The biggest issue l have that somehow the development team is not really able to provide matching sets in all categories. Some color choices are questionable and very limited. If you plan to stick with the basegame only you won't explore the full fun. You will need to buy DLCs to improve the gameplay. Overall l dislike a lot of things how they handled yet it captivates me and am intrigued by my simmies. I hope they will improve even though they started to recolor and adjust certain meshes which get repetitive and EA wants money for that, too but the Sim community provides million of custom content you can add and make this game your own and with DLCs you can add some gameplay.

También hay que decir que es el juego mas complicado y exigente del Agente 47, nada que ver con las siguientes entregas y mucho menos con los actuales de nueva generación.

El argumento pasa sin mayor trascendencia, ya que carece de importancia, al final no es mas que una escusa para que 47 vuelva a la carga. La historia nunca ha sido la esencia de los Hitman ni su punto fuerte, y la verdad que tampoco le hace falta.

La jugabilidad es la mítica, nos dan un objetivo y debemos de acabar con el de la forma que sea, orquestando una masacre (no lo recomiendo) o utilizando nuestra habilidad e inteligencia para infiltrarnos. También nos pueden encargar objetivos adicionales o secundarios como recuperar un maletín o similares. Podemos llevarnos las armas del enemigo que al final aparecerán en nuestro arsenal para elegir antes de empezar una misión y en nuestra base (que podemos recorrer libremente para ir probando nuestro armamento, aunque no es muy amplia). El disfrazarnos para suplantar identidades es la esencia de cualquier Hitman y aquí no sería menos, sin embargo no será una tarea sencilla ya que la IA enemiga es bastante complicada y sospecharan ante cualquier mínima cosa, incluso si nos ponemos a correr pueden dispararnos. La acción es complicada ya que nos acribillaran con facilidad y nuestro inventario es limitado, las armas como fusiles y escopetas no podemos esconderlas por su tamaño, a diferencia de armas cortas como pistolas y revolveres.

Apartado técnico decente para la época, actualmente se ve bastante bien y cuenta con buenos detalles, como las manchas de sangre y una balística muy realista, así como el manejo de las distintas armas, cada una con su retroceso y potencia. Especial mención a la banda sonora, muy bien realizada.

El juego flaquea en el desarrollo de algunas misiones, que nos obligara a utilizar la acción directa o la infiltración tipo Metal Gear o Splinter Cell, algo para lo que el juego no esta bien diseñado en cuanto a manejo y controles de personaje.

En resumen, Hitman 2 es una gran entrega de sigilo con toques de acción, entretenido, adictivo y exigente, un juego que nos hará pensar y replantearnos nuestra estrategia en mas de una ocasión para hacer el asesinato perfecto y salir vivos en el intento. El buen diseño de niveles, la variedad de opciones en los escenarios y el amplio arsenal que nos permite jugar a nuestro gusto, hacen de Hitman 2 una experiencia mas que recomendable, al igual que la saga en general.",90

Denn grafisch und soundseitig finden wir in diesem ersten Teil einer Trilogie höchstens Durchschnitt vor. Die Story entfaltet sich durchaus interessant und wird nett erzählt, das Balancing stimmt, obwohl ich bisher nur den einfachen Weg beschritten habe. Leider ist die KI an einem Punkt zu stark und verhindert so meinen Fortschritt. Im Verlauf der Geschichte gibt es Haupt- und Nebenquests, die recht abwechslungsreich gestaltet sind und sich selten wiederholen. Ein gewisser Handlungsspielraum ist gegeben, da jede Entscheidung im Spiel einen verschiedenartigen Ausgang zur Folge hat. Das Schicksal über die zukünftige Herrschaft von Avadon liegt damit also allein in unseren Händen.

Mein Fazit: ""Avadon: Black Fortress"" kann ganz passabel unterhalten. Vor allem für RPG-Enthusiasten oder die es noch werden wollen. Andere werden hier aufgrund der technischen Limitierungen nur bedingt glücklich werden.

Subnautica is an aquatic-themed survival exploration game. The premise of the game is that your spaceship has crashed on this primarily water-filled planet. You are aware of alien life present on the planet and are armed with just a knife. You must explore and survive, with your end goal being get off the planet by rebuilding your ship. 

Breakdown
Early access done right
I’d like to start off by pointing out that this game started out in early access and has been completed. There aren’t many games that do that these days. A lot of developers just take the cash and announce the full release the game without fulfilling their promises, or don’t even release it at all!. Early access survival games are mostly seen as a cash grab rather than an opportunity to make a good game. If anyone is interested in seeing how to go about making an early access game, then Subnautica is the perfect example. The devs deserve kudos for their work and integrity.

Mediocre story, No combat
You read that right. The gameplay is ok, and combat is pretty much non-existent in this game. Your only lethal weapon is a knife in a huge ocean, the primary biome, filled with creatures that want to kill you. The beauty of this game lies in its emphasis on exploration without any combat. You are aware of the alien presence near your crash site from the beginning. You explore to discover hidden caves and bases which give you new technology that helps you fix your ship. The game might not have any combat, but it shows that not every survival game needs to be about killing everything in your way. 

Beautiful World
The game is gorgeous. When you are underwater, the god rays moving make it look lifelike. It gives the water this turquoise tint that makes everything underneath, from plants, to animals, and even the terrain, pop and give it a little more edge. This ties in well with the biggest plus point to this game: the exploration. While exploring in other games may be tedious, and even feel like a chore, in this one, it fits right in with the outstanding visuals present. 

What about replayability?
Sadly, this is one thing the game lacks. There isn’t really any incentive to play the game again after finishing it as the story is mediocre, and once you’ve explored everything, you pretty much know everything about the game. Although, there is a creative mode which eliminates what threats there are and lets you build amazing bases you can call home. Thankfully, the crafting and base building systems are fully fleshed out and this game mode is a fun experience.

A simple yet wonderful game
As you may be able to tell by now, this game is very simple, yet a fun experience. It doesn’t try to do much and what it does, it delivers phenomenally well. If you are looking for a casual game that you can kick back and enjoy, then this is it. Whether it is after a rough day’s work, or through the Sunday afternoon, this game will relax you and keep you hooked at the same time. I haven’t even mentioned that it is just the type of game that showcases the beauty of VR and should be a plus point for VR gamers. Subnautica offers about 20 hours of content, and would make a fine addition to the steam library of anyone who likes relaxing games with an emphasis on exploration. Definitely recommended!

Le jeu part d'un bon concept bien que totalement fan service (mais bon , qui na jamais voulue voir des combats goku vs luffy par ex ^^) , mais est-il bien exploité ?

Le fan service est bien au rdv avec plus de 40 personnages jouables , mais le reste beaucoup moins. Le mode histoire présente aucun intérêt c'est à peine si on le remarque , son seul but consiste à vous faire souffrir avec des dialogues / cinématiques interminable qu'on ne peut pas skip. 

Mais bon , somme nous la pour le scénar ? NON ! mais plus pour la baston , alors que donne ce système de combat. Bhaaaa , il est moyen , il a pour avantage d'avoir une prise en main facile , voir même trop. Il ne demande pas énormément de skill comme Street Fighter ou tekken pour lâcher de gros combo , le système reste trop assister. Et le système de garde lui est aussi robuste qu'un barrage de gilet jaune, il arrête absolument tout et ceci peu donner de combat bien vide contre certain adversaire... 
Si vous cherchez un système complexe vous allez être déçus , mais pour ceux qui veule juste se mettre sur la gueule avec des animations et effets spectaculaires vous n'allez pas être déçus.

Les graphismes sont excellent ainsi que les animations , le seul reproche qu'un peu trouver est que par moment avec certain coup , le jeu peu paraître surcharger d’animation et embrouiller le joueur , hors-ceci rien à redire.

En conclusion , le jeu reste plutôt bon et agréable à jouer , il est idéale pour jouer entre potes. Par contre il n'est pas du tout adapter pour la compétition à l'heure actuel à cause de la simplicité de son système de combat et son histoire est complètement secondaire. Le fan services est présent avec plus de 40 personnage jouable donc un qu'un peu personnaliser . Il mérite l'honorable note de 12/20",60

When I finished the whole game, I thought to myself that the DLC may be interesting. And here we have one.

Gameplay isn´t bad at all. It expands basic game, so only thing I could say is that the driving mechanics are really bad and whole driving is odd. For PC it feels like console port and control for gamepads. They promised us tons of things and nothing from it was fulfilled.

From graphics side I can surely say it is one of the best looking games. And if you download one special mod, it will also allow you to manually change it and it deepens the game atmosphere.

Story builds on the predecessor. You have to stop Corporate and regenerate the power from Chicago Club. You can´t trust anybody and your mission is secret. I found too many cliches in this story. It isn´t even interesting.

In Darksiders 2 you will play as one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Death.

Death, will try to clear his brother War’s name by restore humanity, where War is convicted by destroying it. The story line was interesting and in my opinion it could be better, but in general it’s fine. Even though the world in Darksiders 2 is way bigger than the previous game, but it wasn’t good since there is not that much to explore. I guess the reason is so the can add more side quests and give the game more hours. the game comes with new skill system, where you have two paths, but still can mix each path skill with another. You have Harbinger Tree (Warrior path) and Necromancer Tree (Spellcasting path).

I liked the fact they didn’t make it like the previous game where you can buy your skills, but sill I don’t think it should be that much of skills. War as in the previous game has only four skills and they were perfect as they suite its character, which is the opposite in this game, even though his name is Death, you won’t feel the meaning of his name, except his Reaper form. I fact that you get gold after slaying an enemy when it was a souls in the last game it’s really confusing, since you use them to purchases items from demon called Vulgrim, who mentioned that he have no use of gold in Darksiders 1 and asked for souls as currency. And since we playing with Death, the souls will suit it more.

Weapons system I really didn’t like, in this game they allowed you to use different varieties of weapon; such as, Hummer, Swords, maces and etc, beside Death main weapon Scythe. the problem is unlike the previous game where you can use only War’s sword (Chaoseater), and the more you kill the more Chaoseater become strong and upgraded. In Darksiders 2 the Scythes are not different than other weapons. All these extra thing killed the character, you barley can see him as death. Even his agility, the way he moves, walk on walls doesn’t suit Death. Which makes you wonder how are they gonna deliver Strife character (One of Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse).

The graphics isn’t bad at all, and I hope they won’t change it.

To sum up, the game was a big surprise where there is a huge difference between it and the previous one. Even though they fail to deliver Death character as it should be, you will mostly like and enjoy the fights and the character. the story was great and really interesting. I hope the make the next game more like the first one, more Action than RPG as it suit the story and the characters more.",80

Not only the controls feel much better, the new gadgets like the (Bavarium powered) wingsuit and the retracting tethers alone sell it for me. Out of ammo? Just pull a helicopter into a gas tank and watch it explode. The world design is just amazingly done and beautiful. It is smaller than Panau from Just Cause 2, but also better filled with interesting landmarks and a better variety of things to blow up. Yes the story and characters are as cheesy as they can get. But do you really expect some serious characters with a rich and interesting past to tell you about? This game is just like it's predecessors a playable action movie with a lot of freedom where you can play with your creativity.

But there is a few big downside which are pretty much unnecessary and could've been avoided in making this game. 

downside:+ a few negative points under this text
performance
The performance is sometimes and without tweaking a catastrophe. My PC is high-end and so way over the recommended requirements (i7 7700k, 16GB ram, GTX1070, game installed on SSD) and the FPS sometimes just tank down to ~40 FPS. But that luckily rarely happened in my hours of play time. A simple restart of the game also fixed that for me. 

There is a very helpful guide in the steam guides posted that helps fixing the performance completely. Aside from the framedrops that I mentioned earlier the game ran always at over 60 FPS with all settings on maximum.

Repetetive 
The whole game feels this way, from the stories to the bases to .. everything. They did well giving another look to each base for sure but it does not feel as rewarding as it was in Just Cause 2. 

All in all I would still recommend this game to everyone who likes a good action open world sandbox, even though the setup is annoying. But the fun you will get out of this game is worth taking the 10 minutes to configure it. As long as you don't tab out of the game of course. :p

Resident Evil 2 es un juego que nadie se deberia perder, si bien se de antemano que no es para todo el mundo, es un juego estresante, agobiante y sobre todo dificil; es para aquellas personas que valoran un reto sobre otras cosas, por supuesto, un survival horror con todas las letras. Y espero que Capcom entienda de una vez por todas que este es el camino a seguir, no solo haciendo remakes, sino nuevos juegos de la saga Resident Evil o de otras sagas muertas, o incluso nuevas, pero de esta manera, sin abusos contra los jugadores, y con una dosis impresionante de creatividad.

Tan solo me queda decir ¡Bienvenido de nuevo Resident Evil! Y espero que esto genere una nueva ola en juegos Survival Horror de este estilo, que ya lo veníamos necesitando desde hace mucho tiempo.

This game has everything good about the first game plus even more interesting game elements. The biggest addition is the naval combat, which is there in spades. This game is like most other CRPGs where game offers you a chance to make the character you wish and level them up as they progress through the story as well as recruiting allies and teammates.

*Find Yourself!*
This game offers you a chance to create any character you wish. You can make them look however you wish in terms of appearance. You can choose from a variety of classes, you can be a druid or a mage, a wizard or a warrior the choice is wide and it is yours. You can also dual class and be a mix of different classes, for example you can be a battle-mage, a character who is focused on battling with a bit of magic to maybe buff yourself and allies. One thing the game does better than most other games in the genre is that it offers you a LOT of choices, as you level up in terms of new skills and abilities. The game also lets you choose to continue from your save in the first game, if you have played it. You basically take your character and a few decisions from the first game carry over. But fear not, if you haven’t played and are missing out on the story because this game does a good job of catching you up with the events of the previous game. Others have said that not playing the first one didn’t create a huge difference or gaps in story, but they wish that they have had played it, as it is also a great game.

*Best Combat in the Genre?*
I am a huge fan of this genre and out of all the games I must say this is the one. This is a huge compliment because a lot of games don’t do combat right in this genre. This game has real time combat with the ability to pause it. You can also have the AI to control your allies, although as you play more of the game I suggest you take control of them yourself for more precise decisions. This is something that the other games also have, but there is a certain way that combat has been balanced in PoE 2 that it makes everything feel just right without being too difficult to learn. Don’t get me wrong there is a learning curve for the hardcore fans, but the skill floor is quite low to accommodate for newer players of the genre.

*Ship Combat: Good or Bad?*
The answer to that question is - actually both. The naval combat in this game is good but can also be bad at times and that is the only negative thing I have to say about the game. The ship combat initially is quite dull compared to the rest of the game as it takes form in a text-based format. It makes the game feel like the text-based games from 30 years ago but with a lot of RNG. Although there are some elements that are good about it. There are several roles on the ship and you need the right people in the right role to do those jobs. If you have a surgeon firing the canons, then don’t expect to be hitting a lot of the shots. There is also boarding and that is the highlight of the naval combat. The combat scenarios that come up when you are boarding a ship or being boarded yourself are definitely one of the most fun times in this game. I don’t know why exactly but I guess it might be that it is very close quarters combat in a game like this doesn’t happen often.

*Hours and Hours of Content*
This game is definitely worth picking up and it even does a good job of easing newer players into the genre. It has hundreds of hours worth of content and that is just on a single playthrough. This game offers a tonne of re-playability with the option of multiple character with different playstyles.

Literally nothing - not a single positive point comes in my mind for Battlefield V.
I am not going to explain why the game is one of the worst games ever developed & if you don't get why, please don't talk.
The actual best state of the game was after the release (Edited this review since then).

If you like this game; following things might be the reason:
- You are a casual & just want to play a game (that's totally okay btw)
- You were promoted/paid by EA/DICE to vote their game up (if so, no words for you)
- You started playing the BF franchise with Battlefield V and you have no idea what a good Battlefield is

Friendly reminder if you care about that point - Battlefield V reveal:
""There won't be any microtransactions! Everything can be unlocked trough just playing the game."" 
Well, take a look now ;)

Just don't .. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, NOR YOUR TIME. Why?
Worse than ever before. Just listing a few negative points:
- Lack of optimization 
- Bugs & glitches
- Complete mess called ""movement""
- Input delay
- Week for week new unplayable playlists
- no RSP with plugins
- In-game / weapon & vehicle balance 
- Countless cheater 
- Skill trees instead of weapon attachments 
- Level & unlock system
- In-game UI
- Random recoil of guns
- Gunplay in general
+ 5 points down below.
... the list could go on.

@DICE SW / EA - Keep doing what you do: Ignore constructive feedback and you ruin your studio(s) even more then you already do now.

Le jeu part d'un bon concept bien que totalement fan service (mais bon , qui na jamais voulue voir des combats goku vs luffy par ex ^^) , mais est-il bien exploité ?

Le fan service est bien au rdv avec plus de 40 personnages jouables , mais le reste beaucoup moins. Le mode histoire présente aucun intérêt c'est à peine si on le remarque , son seul but consiste à vous faire souffrir avec des dialogues / cinématiques interminable qu'on ne peut pas skip. 

Mais bon , somme nous la pour le scénar ? NON ! mais plus pour la baston , alors que donne ce système de combat. Bhaaaa , il est moyen , il a pour avantage d'avoir une prise en main facile , voir même trop. Il ne demande pas énormément de skill comme Street Fighter ou tekken pour lâcher de gros combo , le système reste trop assister. Et le système de garde lui est aussi robuste qu'un barrage de gilet jaune, il arrête absolument tout et ceci peu donner de combat bien vide contre certain adversaire... 
Si vous cherchez un système complexe vous allez être déçus , mais pour ceux qui veule juste se mettre sur la gueule avec des animations et effets spectaculaires vous n'allez pas être déçus.

Les graphismes sont excellent ainsi que les animations , le seul reproche qu'un peu trouver est que par moment avec certain coup , le jeu peu paraître surcharger d’animation et embrouiller le joueur , hors-ceci rien à redire.

En conclusion , le jeu reste plutôt bon et agréable à jouer , il est idéale pour jouer entre potes. Par contre il n'est pas du tout adapter pour la compétition à l'heure actuel à cause de la simplicité de son système de combat et son histoire est complètement secondaire. Le fan services est présent avec plus de 40 personnage jouable donc un qu'un peu personnaliser . Il mérite l'honorable note de 12/20",60

As a result, we can see many amazing games have been developed. Multiple organizations are working in this niche, and no doubt, they have provided us excellent results. Actions games are one of the most lovable and played games. While visiting the web or the market, you will find a massive list of action games. If you are tied off playing old action games, then how about trying the most updated one? In this article, we are going to tell you about one of the most popular action games that are renowned for its storyline and other features.
""Hitman"" is one of the best stealth video game series ever, and to keep your typical sequel expectations in check, it's best to think of Hitman 2 as season two of the 2016 revival. The game doesn't have numerous new highlights, yet it conveys every one of the six of its sharp murder sandboxes on the double.
If we compare hitman 2 with its old edition, we cannot observe many changes in it. Basically, it is quite similar to the previous one, but many more feature is added in it, and graphics are also improved. Simply, it will force you and will also keep you attract with the game.
The game continues the same story by the older version named as a Hitman. If you are curious to know about the amazing new additions and features and the reviews of hitman 2, then let's have a look at the features and reviews that will surely make you fall in love with this game.

More updated features of the Hitman 2
Some amazing features of a game become the reason for engagement between the player and the game. Similarly, some features of Hitman 2 will force you to play the game. One of the essential elements that the programmers have added in this game is the stunning map. At every new stage, you must require a locale with other variety.
Starting the game at the first stage, you will break into a deserted looking fortified beach home, and there you will learn some basics. After that, in other missions, you will explore many other locations. Each level is different from each other, not only story-wise, but the music, graphics, and various characters also play an important role.
Several challenging stages in the game:
If you are an energetic and adventurous person who loves to face challenges and are also fond of living and winning in a challenging environment, then hitman 2 is the best option for you. Hitman 2 is far different from other games where you immediately run to see the missions. Reading the maps in the game is quite tricky, and it will surely consume your precious time. The stunning part about hitman 2 is that at each level, several challenges are waiting for the player, and they are not like the ordinary ones that include killing 20 people or poisoning the person, and they are far more challenging and exciting than what you think. Hitman 2 will also give you many opportunities in the form of surprise challenges that will help you out to earn rewards and much more.

Impressive changes in the game
After attempting HitmanHitman, the audience was expecting more from the developers and no doubt, that they haven't disappointed us. It wouldn't be wrong in stating that hitman 2 came with the same features that we were expecting. Similarly, to the Hitman, you will get the chance to explore six different locations, and to complete your missions successfully, you will make use of people and objects present in your surroundings.
Even the progress criteria are the same that getting caught for the lowest number of times in-game during the mission means more success while the higher caught rate in a mission can lead to lower success or can even lead to a failure in the game. The overall changes and new additions in hitman 2 are more astonishing and breathtaking. It introduces the new qualities for Agent 47 that makes him more efficient as for hitman 2, and he can walk in-crowd, hide in tall trees, to see the enemies or target, a mirror can be used. Else then this, the UI changes are also remarkable.

Ghost mode in Hitman 2
While playing Hitman 2, you will become addicted to it, and you will attempt the same level several times just because while playing, you will understand the character behaviors mechanism and much more in a better way. To keep you connected and interested, Hitman 2 provides you with an amazing multi-player feature called ghost mode. This mode is a big attraction that lets you play against another player and become the first one to hit the target. Hitman is full of surprises and challenges that will always attract you to play it. There are a variety of ways to kill an enemy. Just play the game by yourself and explore what's interesting is inside it.

Power to create their own story
If you get control over the game, what's better than that and hitman 2 gives you the control of the game. Let us observe how Hitman 2 allows you to enjoy the game in your own style.
Well, this feature is not a new one in the gaming industry, but combining with other features enhances the quality of the game.

Cons of the game
As it is a fact, that everything has its pros as well as cons. In a similar way, Hitman 2 also has some cons in it. No doubt, hitman 2 is the perfect combo of entertainment and challenges; some people who have previously played HitmanHitman may or may not find it interesting or unique.
The basic reason behind the disappointment of the people in the game is its similarity with the previous version. There are a lot of new additions, but still, the new version is a continuity of the HitmanHitman. Having similar features in Hitman 2 can be a reason for disappointment for gamers.

Conclusion
Hitman 2 is a full package that contains both entertainment and knowledge in it. It is an attraction for the game lovers. Not just the game idea but its structure, and its music all are loved immensely. If it provides you with several capabilities and systems. It provides a player with various tools to kill and to perform other activities.
There is a strict scoring system in the game, and if you score 91/100 in the game, it is not a bad deal. If you have an interest in action games, then choosing hitman 2 is not the bad option, even it will also make progress in your gaming experience.

It is the fourth game in the Just Cause series and the successor to its 2015 game Just Cause 3. A somewhat similar game to this one is Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Breakpoint. They are the same genre, both are TPS shooter and you will find some similarities in the gameplay.
Just Cause 4 is set in a fictional South American country named Solis, which is home to some extreme weather conditions. The game has been launched at the end of 2018.

Special features
In this game you have a wingsuit which gives you some cool gameplay experience. You can go skydiving, base jumping and free dive with no limits. You will fight your enemies under some extreme weather conditions, including treacherous tornadoes and lighting storms. Also, a special thing in this game is that you can use the extreme weather events to your advantage thanks to the never seen before in-game physics.
The plot takes place after the events of Just Cause 3 when Rico Rodriguez is approached by a Solis native, Mira Morales. She convinces him to come to Solis to uncover the truth about Project Illapa. The projects scope is to create weather cores able to control the weather and create storms. Also, Miguel Rodriguez (Rico’s father) had a part in creating those. The project is run by the incumbent Solis leader Oscar Espinosa. He maintains strict control over the people of Solis. What you need to do is to dive into the South American nation of Solis, the homeland of the Black Hand and search of answers.

Graphics and art design
Even though the game still has some bugs the graphics will make up for it. The art design plus the graphics for this game make a good combination making it look somehow realistic with all the shadows and reflections. Speaking of the art design itself, it is very good giving the game a very tropical feeling.

Better that the Older Games?
This game still needs some improvements. The bugs must be fixed for sure, but after all this is still a good game. I can’t say for sure if this is better than some of the older ones in this series, but if you liked previous JC games, you will like this one for its story and gameplay. In conclusion, I can recommend this game for all TPS and JC lovers.

Non mi aspettavo molto da questo gioco, l'avevo scaricato dall'humble monthly solo perchè in questo giorni sono in fissa con Warhammer 40k, ma Mechanicus è un gioco a turni di tutto rispetto che è riuscito addirittura ad immergermi ancora di più nella storia di WH40k e a farmi ordinare il mio primo set di miniature di Warhammer 40k degli Adeptus Mechanicus.

Ici vous allez devoir construire votre hôpital et le gérer en recrutant le personnel, l'organiser en plusieurs services comme les urgences, la radioloagie, la cardiologie, la chirurgie général (interne), l'orthopédie, la neurologie...

La partie construction vous permet de créer des pièces que vous pourrez équiper avec pas mal de matériel, plusieurs éléments de décoration sont possibles. L'installation d'ascenseur vous permet de construire sur plusieurs étages. Les équipements se débloque à mesure que vous réalisés des objectifs pour des assurances, d'ailleurs ce sont ces dernières qui vous enverrons un quota de patient par jour.

Côté gestion, il vous faudra recruter des personnels qualifiés suivant le poste. Leur expérience augmentera avec la pratique et un jeune médecin deviendra performant avec le temps. Il faudra organiser des équipes de jour et nuit, cependant l’hôpital ne fonctionne pas 24h/24 pour les urgences, c'est plus proche d'une clinique. Malgré ce détail, vos ambulances répondent quand même aux urgences que peuvent couvrir vos services.

Le petit plus, c'est que vous avez possibilité de prendre en main directement des patients et décider des examens et traitement approprié, car suivant l'efficacité du personnel, certains diagnostiquent peuvent être erronés.

Les graphismes en vue isométrique sont détaillés, mais il n'est pas possible de faire pivoter la vue. Intégralement traduit en français, il vous permettra de comprendre mieux certaines pathologies.

Un titre recommandé aux fans de construction/gestion, l'approche du jeu reste assez compliquée et demande un temps d'adaptation, les explications ne sont pas toujours très clair sur les différentes interactions avec les salles.

This is definately one of my favourite games of all time.When the game launched it was really one of a kind.The characters,the mechanics of the game,the atmosphere and the graphics.
Everything is spectacular.
The game as an idea is totally awesome.I mean,who wouldn't want to control real-time legendary fights between ancient warriors.
For Honor offers many characters for you to choose what suits your playstyle the most.
It's a really fun game to play with your friends when you're way better than them since it feels awesome to hear them cry when you stab them in the foot with your Gladiator!
The game is still alive after all these years..Its community is much smaller now than before but there are still people that are enjoying themselves playing it.
Regular updates are a thing.There is always new content coming up.By saying new content i mean new characters to play cause as far as the events and gamemodes are concerned,your options are really limited.
On the other side of the spectrum though,the game is owned by Ubisoft and this tells us a lot.
It's a great game idea as i said before but the balance between the game characters is ridiculous.Some characters are way op and some others are just dogshit if you can't actually handle them like a pro.
In conclusion,For Honor is an awesome game to play and have fun,but it's also a game that would easily make you throw your keyboard at a wall and make you atheist.I would recommend you to buy it only because it offers a unique experience that no other game of its genre can actually offer you right now.
Enjoy the game!

우선 게임을 끝 마칠 수 없다는 사실부터 시작하고 싶습니다. 왜냐하면 게임은 항상 마지막 경주 시리즈 중 하나에서 충돌하기 때문에 진행 상황을 방해합니다 (4 번 연속). 그리고 내가 1을 배치 할 때만 충돌합니다. 나는 시리즈를 한 번 잃어 버렸고 3 위를 차지했지만 충돌하지 않았습니다. 기묘한...
이 게임의 또 다른 문제는 연삭입니다. 최종 시리즈의 잠금을 해제하려면 77000 포인트가 필요합니다. 그리고 그것이 무엇을 의미하는지 모른다면, 내가 말해 줄 것입니다. 이 게임에는 ""존중 시스템""이 있습니다. 레이스 중에는 다양한 행동 (표류, 위치 획득, 무너짐이없는 랩 등)에 대한 포인트가 있습니다. 레이스에서 승리하면 750 포인트가 주어지고 스타일로 운전할 때 최대 250 점을 얻을 수 있으므로 레이스 당 1000이 최대입니다.
이제 슬픈 부분이 온다. 일부 시리즈에는 1v1 드래그 레이스가 있으며 매우 짧으며 기본적으로 직선입니다. 직선으로 250 점 (주로 표류하기위한 것)을 얻는 방법은 무엇입니까? 최종 승무원에 도착하면 약 73000-75000 포인트를 얻게됩니다. 이제 모든 단일 레이스 시리즈를 재생해야하지만 대부분 1000 점을 얻으려고 노력합니다 (앞서 언급 한 드래그 레이싱 맵에서는 거의 불가능합니다). 당신의 갈기와 함께 행운을 빌어 요!

다음 문제는 게임 경제입니다. 경주 시리즈에서 우승하고 12000 달러를 받았다고 말하지만, 당신은 서투르게 운전하고 있었고 구석 구석마다 항상 차를 추락했습니다. 잘 뭘요? 수리하려면 약 10000 $을 지불해야합니다. (약간 저렴하고 차에 따라 다름). 따라서 실제 소득은 생각보다 훨씬 적습니다. 적어도 AI를 사용하여 베팅을 할 수 있습니다. 더 나은 자동차를 구하려고 할 때 약간 도움이됩니다.

마지막 문제는 엔터테인먼트 가치의 부족입니다. 처음에는 컷씬이 1 개, 끝에는 YouTube에 1이 있습니다. 또한 처음에는 몇 가지 튜토리얼 메시지가 있습니다. 당신은 또한 임의의 AI 캐릭터를 경주하고 (매우 지루해집니다), 자동차를 업그레이드하고, 새로운 차를 구입하십시오 (충분한 돈을 저축 한 경우) 소녀를 데리러 오십시오. 당신의 차 운전을 자동적으로 보는 쓸모없는 특징 (3 개의 관광 장소에서만).

Se jeux a vraiment tout pour plaire. 

Le jeux ne se prend pas la tête sur une quelconque stratégie ou autre, c'est un jeux somme toute dans un principe de fonctionnement tout simple, on a un vaisseaux, on améliore ou crée de nouvelle arme, on suis les quète, on gagne de l'argent, on combat, on achète de meilleur vaisseaux, en soit le principe de base est simple.

L'histoire est intéressante, sans être exceptionnelle, les combat sont très beaux, immersif et parfois tactique, le choix des armes est large, le choix des vaisseaux encore plus, et le système de récupération de plan pour ensuite crée des arme, chasseur ou amélioration encore plus puissante est vraiment sympas. Le système qui permet d'améliorer chaque facette du vaisseaux ( comme les bouclier, les arme, les réacteur ) est aussi très interessante.

Se que se jeux a de plus, c'est le fait de pouvoir récupérer les vaisseau adverse en les abordant et en les ramenant a une station spacial ou une base, qui nous demande de vendre ou de garder le vaisseau. On peut aussi choisir de se faire accompagner par 2 mercenaire qui combattrons a nos cotée et de lancer 3 escadrille de chasseur. On a aussi la possibiliter de traquer des '' héro '' qui rapporte une grosse prime a chaque héro abattue, avec une difficulté plus ou moins élevée.

Les 2 DLC du jeux rajoute a eux seul beaucoup de contenue.

Seuls points négatifs pour moi, les mercenaire qu'on engage reste trop loin du vaisseau et intervienne trop lentement, quelque beug très perturbant bien que vraiment rare ( le vaisseau du joueur qui se détruit sans aucune raison avec la vie pleine ), la trop grande faciliter a vendre les arme rare par erreur et enfin, le fait que le jeux devienne assez restreins une fois que tout est fait, même si c'est très long a faire.

The game has a fully interactive story. This game is a sequel to the original Postal game.
Postal 2 is a game about performing daily errands. The game is a classic, with a ton of re-playability.

How dark do you like it?
Postal 2 has a fully interactive story. You can choose what to do. You can peacefully complete these errands, or create a chaotic environment while completing them. No worries though as the concept of the story is easy to pick up and enjoy. The game includes 89 achievements that can be earned easily while playing the game. The errands in the game can be as easy as returning some library books or buying some milk from the store. You can just do these and nothing else, or create a chaotic environment for everyone. This is a basic summary of the game. 

Feels right:
The story is completely comical. However, please just know that this game can come off as offensive at times. Guns are used in the game as frequent as you choose to use them. The gunplay is pretty good for such a classic. There are a variety of guns to choose from. They each feel pretty realistic, with a realistic tone to them.

Graphics and Sound: In a single-player game, graphics and sound is everything. The game manages exceeds my expectations. The game is graphically pleasing. The audio is wonderful, it has the perfect ring to it. The game’s audio and graphics are easily comparable to a newer game, even though this game is over 15 years old! Although single-player games aren’t as popular, as multi-player games because overall they usually feel the same. This game is an exception because of the originality of the game. The game has the 3 things necessary for a good game, good audio, graphics, and gunplay. This game manages to exceed these, even for being so old. The length of the story depends on what you do. It offers a ton of re-playability.

This game is also what has inspired many of the best selling isometric RPGs in the market currently, such as the Divinity: Original Sin and Pillars of Eternity games.

*Write your own stories!*
This game, like the more recent entries in the genre, has a vast and deep character creation system even though this game is around 15 years old! You can choose from a variety of gender, races and professions as well as allocate stats and traits. As you progress through the game you will realize that the story of your friend’s tale and yours will be completely different, simply because of the decisions you have made in the game. At each crossroad or each issue that comes to you in the game there will be a number of different options available for you to take and make your character, be whoever you want them to be. If you want your character to be diplomatic, you can do that, if you want them to be arrogant and cocky you can do that as well. The choice is yours.

*Graphics remade?*
The original game’s graphics definitely looks very dated when compared to modern day gaming. But the Enhanced Edition has polished it up and made it look more modern while keeping the iconic art-style, which is extremely special to the people who have played the original game. Even if the Enhanced Edition graphics aren’t up to the standards of Divinity or Pillars, but don’t let that fool you as this game has so much depth to make up for its shortcomings (which are few). This game has so much quality to offer and to wide variety of tastes. If you like RPGs, sound/music design, art design or great storytelling there is something for you in this game.

*Make your fantasies a reality in this game*
This game lets you go on your own fantasies and adventures, make them a reality, as this game is definitely worth picking up. If you are a fan of RPGs and would like to see how they got to where they are today, then this game will show you what they were like 10-15 years ago. If you are just a fan of quality PC games, then this has quality in spades. Or if you are a game collector than this is definitely a must have for the game library!

Blackwake is a massively multiplayer game centered around naval combat. This game is what Sea of Thieves should have been. You can have massive ship battles against other players. You board ships and fight with guns in first person perspective, which gives this game an FPS element. This game will give you many wonderful hours of playing with friends while fighting off other pirates in the open seas.

Raising a Black Flag
Are you ready kids? Aye aye Captain!
This game has a lot of depth. You can have a ship of upto 10 players with each getting their own role. You may be in charge of manning the cannons, which actually feels realistic and feels amazing when you shoot them. You aim through a small opening in the side of the ship. In the middle of a fight, when your ship takes some damage, you and your crew have to be prepared to split up tasks, as one of you will have to go and patch up the ship, while someone else pumps out the water leaking into the ship. And at the same time, remember to keep shooting those cannons at the enemy. You can even board enemy ships by shooting your grappling hooks. Thankfully, the devs prevents online trolls from ruining your experience by making you need orders from your captain, who is chosen by popular vote, to do so. Fights in Blackwake can get chaotic very quickly, but as long, as you are playing with some friends this will be a blast for sure!

Shoot his head off!
Once the boarding begins, Blackwake becomes an FPS. You will have your loadouts with various guns to choose from, such as: a blunderbuss, a musket, or even just a standard pistol. Moments like calmly drinking tea at the heat of the battle to recover some hp while your friends yell orders and requests for help can be funny as well and adds to the charm of the game. One of the biggest positives for this game is that it has made communication very easy. Even if you don’t have a mic, you won’t have many problems since this game has a really well made commo rose similar to that found in the battlefield series. As you may have guessed, this was a great move by the devs as this game requires a lot of communication.

We’re flooding, Captain!
As for the negatives, the only one right now is the fact that the game doesn’t have a large player base, but you can chalk that down to the game being a niche early access game. Don’t expect this to be a problem after full release. 

Pirates Night!
Personally, this is a fun game to play in some free time with friends. That being said, you can always find players on forums and such to organize play sessions with, quite easily. Trying to keep the chaos that the combat of Blackwake inevitably descends to with friends is an experience that you will want to keep returning to. The game is incredibly well made with the only problem being its somewhat small player base, but once you can find a few friends to play with, it won’t really be a problem. Recommended!

Not only the controls feel much better, the new gadgets like the (Bavarium powered) wingsuit and the retracting tethers alone sell it for me. Out of ammo? Just pull a helicopter into a gas tank and watch it explode. The world design is just amazingly done and beautiful. It is smaller than Panau from Just Cause 2, but also better filled with interesting landmarks and a better variety of things to blow up. Yes the story and characters are as cheesy as they can get. But do you really expect some serious characters with a rich and interesting past to tell you about? This game is just like it's predecessors a playable action movie with a lot of freedom where you can play with your creativity.

But there is a few big downside which are pretty much unnecessary and could've been avoided in making this game. 

downside:+ a few negative points under this text
performance
The performance is sometimes and without tweaking a catastrophe. My PC is high-end and so way over the recommended requirements (i7 7700k, 16GB ram, GTX1070, game installed on SSD) and the FPS sometimes just tank down to ~40 FPS. But that luckily rarely happened in my hours of play time. A simple restart of the game also fixed that for me. 

There is a very helpful guide in the steam guides posted that helps fixing the performance completely. Aside from the framedrops that I mentioned earlier the game ran always at over 60 FPS with all settings on maximum.

Repetetive 
The whole game feels this way, from the stories to the bases to .. everything. They did well giving another look to each base for sure but it does not feel as rewarding as it was in Just Cause 2. 

All in all I would still recommend this game to everyone who likes a good action open world sandbox, even though the setup is annoying. But the fun you will get out of this game is worth taking the 10 minutes to configure it. As long as you don't tab out of the game of course. :p

Graphismes : bon.

Gameplay : on ne se prend pas la tête. 
Par élément : 1 enchaînement Cac, 1 att. distante, 1 aoe. Et de toute façon on on ne finit par ne faire que les aoe vu les dégâts et l'inefficacité des autres attaques.
3 éléments seulement, mais si ça parait peu, je préfère ça à certains jeux qui se perdent dans des 8/9 éléments où l'on ne sait pas quoi jouer.
Tous les éléments se valent. Leur puissance ne va être définie que par les pièces d'armures.

Finally Hitman is back. I was disappointed by Absolution, it was a very dumbed down Hitman game, with only couple of good levels first being the best one. The new Hitman game gave everything I desired and more.

It is a completely different game. You’re being thrown into huge levels and must eliminate your targets. But unlike in Absolution you can choose countless ways to do that. You can explore the maps, find disguises and walk almost freely everywhere or you can sneak. You can kill innocent people or just knock them out. Shooting everyone will not work here like it worked in Absolution. You can make your game easy or hard depending on your playstyle. Sneaking while wearing suit might be very hard. If you get appropriate disguise you’re safe to walk around. So it’s up to you how to play. Disguise works differently now and has logic to it. If lets say you knock out a security guard and get his uniform, some security guards will get suspicious but most of them will not notice there's something wrong with you. Same goes for all other disguises, so while you can move freely you must avoid some people.

You can simply follow your targets and kill them, you can lure them into a bathroom by poisoning their drink and drown them in a toilet, you can set up an accident and electrocute or blow up your target. If you have a required tool you can disguise as mechanic for example and drop the lamp on your poor target. You can infiltrate the most secure zone, make your target think that you’re someone else, talk to him and then kill him. There are countless ways to achieve your goal. This game has really good replayability value, it has challenges and various timed events, so every playthrough can be totally different.

Graphics are really nice, can’t say anything bad about it. Game runs well, there’s many object on the screen and many things happening on the map, fps stays steady most of the time. Game looks brilliant, so much detail, so much going on.

Many people disliked episodic format. I personally liked it. There are couple of reasons why. First is that releasing episode after episode developers always can improve the next episode depending on user feedback. Another thing is, if you want to buy it day one you don’t need to spend 60€ on it, you buy one episode, save some money, buy another one, so it works better for people who can’t pay full price. It’s a shame if this was the reason why the game sold poorly. But I think there’s another reason to it which contributed to poor sales. Absolution…well…it wasn’t good, people were disappointed and were afraid to buy this one, especially when it’s released by Square Enix, I love them, own most of their games, but sometimes they make stupid decisions. But to my surprise this game has only one DLC and no pre-order. I hope the second season will follow the same formula – no DLC and pre-order bonuses.

Another thing people disliked is always online. I personally have no problems with that, but I can understand those who has. But hey it's 2017, who doesn't have internet these days?

So if you like absolute freedom, sandbox style gameplay, want many hours of enjoyment get this, you’ll not be disappointed.

Call of Duty: Ghosts is here and is really in the ordinary Call of Duty-fashion.

""So we can't change too many of the core rules, and the core rules are really simple. You're a player, it's in first-person, you have a weapon in your hand and you run around shooting other people."" 

The words above come from Infinity Wards executive producer Mark Rubin and is about the Call of Duty series. He draws a parallel between the incredibly popular game series and football, and says that if one of the sport's suddenly decided to only have seven players on the pitch and that you also get to use your hands, the people would loose interest and stop attending matches.
This conservative philosophy exist for the huge crowd of fans of the series who will recognize it and not get lost in strange novelties. 
And it has left a distinct mark on the new addition to Call of Duty: Ghosts, as in every way, this is exactly what one would expect of a new game in the series.

The campaign begins in an idyllic American place where you sit and talk with your father and brother.
In ordinary Call of Duty-fashion, there are not many minutes before the first explosion color the sky red and the everything falls into chaos. 
Bombs are slamming into the right and left, buildings destroyed before your eyes and you have to survive at any cost.
It starts out pretty good with a premise that arouses interest. 
The South American Federation takes control of the weapon Odin and kills millions of American citizens with bombs. When they have the upper hand they invade the injured shot nation that relies on it feared special dressing Ghosts to turn things around and win the war against all odds.

The campaign is just as exciting and intense as one would expect, with so many explosions that you almost get a nice tan in front of the screen. In a never-ending stream of scenes, we take us through runaway trains, drive a snowmobile across frozen lakes, deep dive among sharks and visit the vacuum of space while we are shooting thousands of opponents to death.
But unfortunately, while the campaign is very full of action, it's completely brain dead. 
Some scenes are so stupid that I just laugh out straight. Clichés succeed each other and to say the least incredible sequence of events is explained with intrigue that could have been written by monkeys at the zoo. 
Or how about a good guy transformed into a vicious sadist who's fed with crops from the South American 

And we have it here with the Call of Duty dog. Infinity Ward assured that we would care about this mutt that comes with along the way, but that is not the case, and the question is rather if they tried to achieve that goal at all. My dog is acting in a fairly useless in a Supporting Role as quickly wasted and then fall in total oblivion. Infinity Ward know their explosions and ""follow the leader with Weapons"" torques, but to tell a believable and interesting story, they really can't.
Fortunately, the multiplayer is still the series' strengths and savior. For the most part, I'm having a lot of fun with the various play modes. My favourite mode is ""hunted"" - a situation where one armed with a pistol at the beginning of the round and then must collect crates to get access to better firepower. Free for all on the game's smallest maps are wonderfully chaotic with the perfect balance between chance and skill.

For me, standing just outside the core group who love the series for what it is, it becomes problematic with few functioning news. Should not a giant company, Activision, with all the money resounding success of Call of Duty draws in, deliver something bigger? Something that makes me lose my breath as nails sticking controller in my hands and pushing me to defy feelings of fatigue and hunger?
There are probably things you don't have time for when a new game is to be replaced every year - then it might just be more of the same. 
Which in the case of Call of Duty: Ghosts works very well because its heart-racing action as the series' hallmark still stands up so well in the competition and delivers an entertaining multiplayer experience.

The question is: How long does it?",70

The GRAPHICS are top notch, making some landscapes very realistic. Making it seem more like a photo than a video game.
Optimised for high and low performance computers. I was able to play it comfortably on a low budget laptop.

The GAMEPLAY is easy enough to get the hang on and yet full and more complex than a normal racing game. Good enough to make you want to get back in the game even after months of absence.

The STORY is a fair one. Not too complicated, therefore easy to follow. But as an essential part of a game, the main story left me unsatisfied, waiting for more. Which it shouldn't. Therefore i give it a lower rating than the other 2.

If you like racing games, this one is for you. There is no doubt. But as that - A racing game. You shouldn't expect a mind-blowing story because it focuses more on the experience of the gameplay.",80

La historia, si bien simple y clara, se desarrolla a buen ritmo y con giros sin perder de vista las historias personales de los compañeros, que son igual de interesantes y que tienen un impacto en la relación que tienen con el protagonista. La historia es más similar a la de DAO, por lo que es claro que están volviendo a sus raíces. Pero no os engañéis, tiene mucho más micro-historias, dobles verdades y mitología de lo que primeramente se ve. Los escritores han hecho un gran trabajo, especialmente con cierto personaje.

Los personajes son increíbles, mucho mejores que sus antecesores, y con una variedad muy interesante, incluso en gusto por romance, lo que los hace estar mejor construidos y darles un punto más veraz. Los banters entre ellos son diversos, aunque me habría gustado que hubiera más, ya que saltan cada 20min aproximadamente y es mucho tiempo. Los romances con ellos son interesantes, emocionan y divierten. Lo bueno es que tus compañeros pueden enamorarse entre sí si no haces romance con ellos, lo cual añade una profundidad a la historia y a la realidad de la misma (no todos los PJ tienen que estar enamorados del protagonista).

El modo de combate está muy mejorado, es divertido y tiene una cámara táctica como en DA2, lo cual permite dar órdenes a los compañeros de manera más sencilla o, si nos gusta la estrategia, pues más clara. Siguen las combinaciones de poderes entre clases, así como la especialización de la clase del protagonista. Lo bueno de la especialización es que podemos ""probarla"" antes ya que cada compañero es un ejemplo de su clase. (Ejemplo: Cole, Sera y Varric son pícaros; Cole = asesino, Sera = Tempestad, Varric = Artífice).

El ambiente es de los más hermosos y mejores que he visto, están muy detallados y muy conseguidos. Hay lugares donde dan ganas de perderse y quedarse solo observando el lugar. Además, hay mucha variedad: desde páramos helados, a bosques, llanuras, pantanos y desiertos (cada uno de ellos desatando banters al respecto por parte de los compañeros de equipo). Los mapas son abiertos y libres de ser explorados, además de grandes, posiblemente ""The Hinterlands"" (primer mapa) sera el más grande y tedioso de todos.

La música es una delicia, un poco repetitiva en el estilo, pero cuidada y tratada con mimo. Me encanta el cambio de música en Orlais con su toque ""francés"" y las canciones de taverna.

In this latest review of the war of the three epic realities, developers have chosen an adventure in an open world in which players can explore ancient China and participate in key battles and witness the crucial moments of a significant era.

If you are a veteran of ""Dynasty Warriors"" games in any respect, you will notice the familiar elements of the story. Either way, an open world for one player is full of surprises, depending on how you watch it. Only its existence adds a lot of unprecedented shades of gaming, most of which are optional. However, in this part of ""Dynasty Warriors,"" there is much more that you can do than any previous part, and the game also attracts players by having a large number of RPG elements.

Ready Set Hunt!

You will be caressing, lying, cooking and collecting things. Every secondary shootout happens for resources. The items you collect, the animals you hunt and the fish you catch will allow you to make objects and weapons; Cooking meals improves your skills and gives you the chance to earn XP. Of course, you do not have to do any of this to progress through the game. These activities are there only to build your character, and your concern can depend on the campaign and the stories of the person you choose. However, if all these additions were measured on an RPG scale, they would not be worth much because everything is largely lacking in comprehensiveness. Every secondary task is nothing more than going to an object, unless it's about helping your allies get to the main campaign in the campaign. Those who give you tasks and goals themselves are nothing special, nothing worth remembering. They are here to get XP points, prey and (in some cases) to help you learn about the world and how it works. Each side trip serves to help you prepare for great battles.

Then, there is a research, a function that is almost completely new in this franchise. In the typical ""Warriors"" game, you never really stop to look around. In ""Dynasty Warriors 9"", the game itself invites you to do just that. When you feel you need a break from fighting and collecting items, you can deal with the viewing of rich environments. Since all of China is accessible to you, you will find yourself in different environments. However, although the open world is relatively beautiful, do not expect to present China in its true light. At first glance, your environment within the game is worth the research. The more you study it, you will be less interesting until you find a new ecosystem. The size of the world in ""Dynasty Warriors 9"" is, however, impressive, and Omega Force deserves applause for making the world that so easily fits the rural, mountainous and bamboo forest areas. What simply misses the game is less blurry frames.

The Three Kingdoms

Improved graphics can be seen where needed - characters look great. They're not perfect, but they're great. Particular attention has been devoted to the details of all our three Kingdoms heroes. We can very easily say that the characters have the most details in the whole game, and if you are a veteran of the fractions, this can provide you with real pleasure. What makes the game even more impressive is the size of the character set. Developers have once again expanded the list, so the game now has over 83 unique characters. Even worth mentioning to soldiers too. Though you will massacre hundreds, if not thousands, of the same faces, we can not deny that their models have been upgraded, especially with regard to armor that very well reflects the illumination of the world. These details help you forget everything else during the fight, and, to be honest, fighting is what counts. Fighting the ""Dynasty Warriors 9"" will compensate for some of the gaps in the game. Bending between Lui Bei, Lu Bu, and Zhou Yu, we noticed sharp animations and unique sets of movements, all of which have the same purpose: killing waves by the wave of enemy hulls.

In addition, developers have expanded the battle from previous parts by implementing new stunts, bumps, and counter-attacks. Counterattacks function as in Arkham Rocksteady games, but this similarity to this game ends. When you start killing your enemies, each ability can ease chain combinations of attacks and flowing movements that seem to last for an entire eternity, and in the middle of a thrilling sea of martial arts, you will discover the soul of this game. You may also notice that the sound design is different for each weapon. If it's blunt, the feedback is dull, and if it's a sword, you'll hear the sound of metal, and so on.

Is that your voice Oh brave warrior?!

However, the sound is another problem in the ""Dynasty Warriors 9"".I am not talking about the ambiance of the environment or the conflict of soldiers, but i am specifically referring to the lending of votes. ""Dynasty Warriors 9,"" tells your story by interlacing the inserts and dialogs in real time (preferring insert). For both of you, you will frown on the characters and their choice of dialogue. This is a joke full of surprises because behind some of the heroes there are good actors, and behind some of them not really. In many unfortunate cases, decisive warriors will excite threats in a faint voice. This is not helped even by the fact that some parts of the written dialogue are simply poor. However, if i need to sort out a good versus bad dialogue, i would say that dialogue, taking into account everything, can pass.

The fact is that ""Dynasty Warriors 9"" functions as an experiment. This is Omega Force's first attempt to make an open world title, and although every aspect of this game is not great, it still represents a package that provides more where it needs and which, in its essence, retains and improves the original H & S (Hack & Slash) experience. When i found myself in a situation that some of my tasks were dead, i would have skipped it and headed straight to the battlefield. Since boring parts are mostly optional, they are not completely negative. At the same time, i was completely impressed when i realized that all the items you collect and all the sites you discover stay in one place between the campaigns, between the characters, and between the kingdoms.

If u play with friends you can test new combs or you can troll and have fun.
If the game getting boring you can play every week a new mode at ""Brawl"".
The rank system is very good and you never get people who leaves or troll, everybody is friendly and communicate with you.

I recommend the game everyone who likes comic graphics and strategic ego shooter.

C'est un jeu fait avec RPG maker par un développeur de talent qui a compris ce que les joueurs attendent de ce genre de jeux et qui sait aussi utiliser RPG maker à la perfection.
Donc c'est le style consoles jrpg avec une histoire bien écrite et des personnages intéressants. Je ne sais pas trop quoi en dire d'autre car il faut y jouer.
Ca se passe dans un monde magique qui flotte au dessus des nuages, et bien sûr ce petit monde idyllique est menacé par une bande de vampires qui veulent le détruire. Bref... C'est le point de départ et l'histoire est brodée autour.
La difficulté est bien dosée, pour un jeu rpg maker les graphismes sont très réussis, les dialogues et les caractères des personnages aussi. Bref, il n'y a que du bon. Je ne vois rien de négatif à en dire et en plus il n'est pas cher

You play the part of Max, an unfortunate wanderer with a troubling past. You charge across open roads in search of redemption, running over those who stand in your way.

Der Tag bzw Genre Horror passt hier nicht wirklich. Kein richtiges Gruselspiel.

Unseren Kahn steuern wir ganz simpel über WASD. In vier Stufen bestimmen wir den Vortrieb, links und rechts geht's stufenlos. Ganz simpel also - und dann doch wieder nicht. Schiffe sind mehr wütende Nashörner als Sportwagen. Richtungsänderungen oder Haltewünsche wollen früh genug vorausgedacht werden, sonst geht's geradewegs auf die nächste Sandbank. Selbst World-of-Tanks-Spieler, deren Tiger-Kampfpanzer auch nicht gerade die Fahrleistungen eines Ferrari bieten, müssen sich daran erst gewöhnen.
Stets gilt die Faustregel: je dicker desto träger. Leicht gepanzerte, wendige Zerstörer manövrieren die gigantischen Schlachtschiffe einfach aus und jagen ihnen aus kurzer Distanz Torpedos in den Rumpf. Die Ozeanriesen, die an Feuerkraft und Panzerung jeder anderen Schiffsklasse überlegen sind, benötigen deshalb Geleitschutz durch Kreuzer, die einen guten Kompromiss aus Feuerkraft und Agilität bieten. Ihre kräftigen Luftabwehrgeschütze halten außerdem den Luftraum sauber.

Flugzeugträger besitzen selbst keine Geschütze und sind deshalb voll auf die Unterstützung ihrer Teamkameraden angewiesen. Dafür sind ihre Torpedobomber der Schrecken jedes Schiffkommandanten - aktuell sind die Träger sogar noch etwas zu stark, sodass das Können der jeweiligen Spieler oft über Sieg oder Niederlage entscheidet. Hier sollte Wargaming noch etwas am Balancing schrauben. Die Stärken und Schwächen der vier Schiffsklassen greifen aber schon jetzt perfekt ineinander.

Auf U-Boote müssen wir übrigens verzichten. Die Unterwasser-Jäger seien an der Wasseroberfläche vollkommen schutzlos und abgetaucht für Teamgefechte nutzlos, so die offizielle Begründung. Ganz ähnlich könnte man aber auch gegen die Implementation der Flugzeugträger argumentieren, die doch ganz hervorragend funktioniert. Für die Zukunft hoffen wir also, dass Wargaming diese Entscheidung nochmal überdenkt, schließlich wissen wir nicht erst seit »Das Boot« oder den Silent-Hunter-Spielen, welchen Nervenkitzel das Duell Zerstörer gegen U-Boot bietet.",80

Como en toda novela visual, leer es la parte más importante del juego, por lo que si no eres mucho de leer párrafos y párrafos de texto, olvídate, porque este juego es un 90% lectura. Dicho esto, si te gusta leer y seguir una historia que te mantenga enganchado, este es tu juego, incluso al principio de este nos recomiendan coger unos snacks, algo para beber y que nos pongamos cómodos.
Por esta parte, de lo que voy de juego ninguna queja, historia interesante, personajes bien escritos y una camarera aun mejor.

El gameplay/jugabilidad, pasando al apartado de la jugabilidad no hay mucho que decir, tienes la mecánica principal de servir bebidas, con las que igual tienes que ""experimentar"" un poco para encontrar la correcta pero no tiene demasiado misterio.

La musica es sublime,además de que el juego tiene un porrón de canciones sobre las que elegir, la gran mayoría son obras maestras, la gran mayoría pegan con el ambiente del juego, cabe destacar que las canciones fueron compuestas exclusivamente para el juego, lo cual no siempre se ve en juegos indie así y para mejorarlo aún, puedes elegir cuales suenan y en que orden (incluso pudiendo controlar el saltarse una canción o volver hacia otra in-game).

Visualmente el juego destaca, ese estilo de arte pixel art con inclinación al anime le da un toque bastante interesante y agradable a la vista. 

Y no se si tengo mucho más que decir, pero bueno, el juego es muy bueno, y por el precio que está aquí creo que es una compra casi obligada.

First thing is that you are here to see a review for the MULTIPLAYER and not the SINGLEPLAYER, (Campaign) there are way better games for that. The main reason I got this is because I always loved killing people and getting those radical killstreaks. Not for the campaign, but for the multiplayer. If you are here for the campaign, leave, campaign is about 6 hours long, and there is a lot better games for that, like Far Cry 4, got lots of hours in that for singleplayer only game time. If you are here for multiplayer, then get your wallet ready!

Some FAQ:

Q: Do people still play?
A: Yes, at certain times and places. Where I am i can get a game quick from 10am to 10pm (West Coast, USA)

Q: Is it worth full price? ($60)
A: No, I did not get it for full price, why should you. Buy on sale or through trading. (Key Trading bots/people)

Q: Should I use my controler?
A: No, you will cry cause you get 0 kills.

Q: Can I read?
A: Yes.

Q: Are you just making up questions to make this review longer?
A: Yes.

Q: Why?
A: Why not? Plus I can't think of them, so ask away!

Review for each part of the game:

Campaign-
No, get other games, its fun but to short.

Multiplayer-

Better then most other CoDs. MW2 I own, to many hackers. MW2 being a good CoD.
This game is one of the best and still has a strong community of people that make it hacker less. 
I also own AW, its bad, and now 0 people are play, #2MuchDLC. 
Worth the buy if it was just for this.

Zombies-
Its another fun game, fun by youself and with others!
Different from most zombie games.

Other Pros/Cons

Pros-
-You get 3 games in your Library
-You only have to download the part of the game you want to play, so less space used!
-Not many hackers! Always a good thing

Cons-
-So much paid DLC; a Gun thats super amazinly good, maps that I would like to play, skins. What is this CS:GO? Paying for skins is so CoD, oh wait.
-Less 8 year olds, I like to talk to them, there fun to mess around with
-Sadly no price drop, unlike MW2 and such old games.

So overall well worth the money for the Multiplayer/Zombies!

The single player campaign will keep you busy and excited the whole time, while the multiplayer, which in my opinion is the best part of this game will make you improve with each game.

In all leagues you will find players matching your rank. As in Wings of Liberty, you will find ladder and non-ladder games. From 1v1 to 4v4, that includes games with A.I., which can be really challenging sometimes, but that depends on you and after some practice they will be no match for you.

You will enjoy the soundtrack and the good graphics. Also you may like the great 3D portraits of the units and the zoom option of the camera, which is not very useful during battle, but for watching replays, could be really nice. 
I cannot skip the great achievements that you earn with gaining experience in the multiplayer matches or trough the campaign, which adds another competitive thing in the game and unlocks new skins for the units, avatars etc.
The new units are really useful and with good balance, I really can't complain about that.

Safety First! is developed by JCO and published by Headup Games. Dev team’s first game release onto Steam, but I think they’re off on the right foot. The title in question is a parody of sorts, but one which doesn’t feel forced and can be quite a challenge to unsuspecting players. For its current price, I consider it a great deal.

Gameplay
Physics-based puzzle platformers aren’t new neither on Steam nor before it. And yet, very few of them mix humor with nerve bending digital acrobatics. You will fail Safety First! a lot, in fact. But you will still laugh at the outcome of your less than stellar results. The humor in this game, considered crude by some players perhaps, is still offering a new perspective upon a genre I frankly felt that I’ve seen enough of it already. The not-so-subtle Magical Yellow Repair Liquid or MYRL for short, is not central to the game’s “plot”. As long as you keep an open mind about it and have plenty of pacience at first, the title will entertain you for quite a few hours. Just do your best to play it with a controller. The keyboard layout only adds unnecessary issues to an already hard game. With several game modes to choose from that are unlocked as you progress through the initial levels, I find it a perfect incentive to be finally able to play the Drunk mode and fail in even funnier ways than you did before.

Not much can be said against or in favor of Safety Fist!’ looks. It could have been more lively, but then again, it acomplishes its purpose even with only a handful of colors. The soundtrack on the modes unlocked later in-game fits the mood and never felt repetitive.

Pros
+ Humorous approach to platforming
+ Level and obstacle diversity with several game modes
+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements
+ Decently priced

Cons
- Tutorial or not, still a fairly difficult game
- Lacks chromatic variation
- Keyboard controls while responsive, not ideal

Result / Final thoughts
Don’t get fooled by its apparent simple looks and goals. Safety First! Is one of the few platformers in recent years that amused me, beyond the regular feelings of frustration that most platform games offer on a regular basis. It’s not to be taken lightly, any game that no matter how difficult instead of rage quitting, puts a smile on your face. You can even skip levels (“cheating”) so stop hitting that keyboard, will you? Use a gamepad and relax. MYRL fixes almost everything.

Il gioco inzia con un uomo misterioso chiamato Endir appartenente ai Masked Tribe, tribù formata da forti guerrieri che lavorano come mercenari. Il tutorial infatti ci presenta questo personaggio accompagnato da un anziano proprio durante una delle missioni a lui assegnate. La prima cosa che emerge, oltre a bellissime ost composte al pianoforte, è l'assenza di emotività di Endir; all'interno del gioco ci sono scelte multiple di dialogo e finora tutte quelle che ho notato rispecchiano questa apatia dell'uomo, cosa che non è facile trovare in un silent protagonist visto che solitamente siano noi stessi a plasmare il carattere di questo.

L'anziano signore ci fa capire quanto Endir viva unicamente per svolgere le sue missioni, ma perchè questo? Ancora non lo so, ma spero venga spiegato più avanti.

Poco dopo aver finito il tutorial, il misterioso uomo mascherato riceve un'ulteriore lavoro da un tizio misterioso che consiste nell' uccidere colei che si immolerà per salvare il pianeta. Si narra infatti da secoli che l'unico modo per scacciare nuovamente le feroci belve dal mondo sia offrire in sacrificio La Prescelta del piccolo villaggio di Nive. Ella compirà un lungo pellegrinaggio insieme ai suoi Guardiani per poter arrivare nel luogo in cui questo macabro rito avrà luogo. Final Fantasy X e Tales of Symphonia wanna be? Vedremo.

L'ironia della sorte è che in questo caso non c'è nessun Tidus o Lloyd e anzi, Endir sembra davvero intenzionato ad uccidere Setsuna, la Prescelta. Senza troppi giri di parole, la ragazza gli fa capire che il suo Pellegrinaggio è importante e che prima o poi morirà, quindi perchè non accompagnarla nel suo viaggio piuttosto che ucciderla subito?

I personaggi finora incontrati mi sembrano tutti validissimi. Aeterna è davvero tanto waifu oltre che essere decisamente preoccupata per la protezione di Setsuna
Gli NPC pure mi sembrano personaggi interessanti!

I am Setsuna nasce con un battle system a turni con l'ATB, ma in chiave moderna e infatti non lo trovo per niente stancante. Oltre al classico attacco fisico con l'arma equipaggiata, ci sono le techs ovvero le abilità che cambiano di personaggio in personaggio.
Non solo, queste teniche possono incrementare di numero grazie a dei cristalli chiamati Spritnite (per i fan della serie Trails corrispondono ai Quartz) che ci permettono di imparare abilità passive e non.

Now, you must be turning your heads away as this genre is quite over-
saturated of late, but fear not, as this game has one extremely crucial
and unique distinction. That is in the story. The premise of the game is
that a war has just gotten over and the “evil” side has won. Now you
work for this faction and are basically cleaning up the aftermath of the
war. And the big difference is that this game gives you total freedom of
your decisions. You can choose to be sympathetic and show mercy to
the people or you can show your dark side and be, as the name of the
game might hint, a tyrant!

*Be Your Own Villain*
This game offers you a very thorough character creation option. You can
choose to be an archer or a swordsman, a rogue or a tank and so on. You
can be whatever you want and customise everything to the tee. This one
feature in itself offers this game a ton of re-playability! Once you
finished the game as a frontline tank, why not try experiencing it as a
wizard? The possibilities are endless!

*Truly Freedom Of Choice*
As I have said in my opening paragraph, this game shows you the other
side of the coin when it comes to the classic tale of Good vs Evil. You are
on the side of Evil and you have to ensure the homeless people who
have had their lived ripped apart in the aftermath of the war are dealt
with. You can choose to throw them all to jail without reason or you can
be a merciful character in a world without heart. The choice is yours.
This is where the RPG element of the game stems from. You can choose to invest in skill points that will aid you on your journey or you can choose ones that might hinder your decisions but help you in combat. This is a vast and diverse system that is easy to understand but has layers of depth for more experienced players. The path is yours to forge!

*Snail’s Pace Combat…Yawn*
This game has a lot of positives but there is one negative aspect to it that
I feel has to be stated in a review, and that is the combat. This is real
time combat with the option to pause so you can micromanage your
party members and use their abilities. There is the option to have the AI
control your party members, so you can keep the combat real time, but
,as you learn more abilities it becomes harder to play using this, as the
computer may not target who you want to target or may heal the wrong
member. So the game immediately forces some amount of
micromanagement on players and on top of that the combat is …. just
dull and extremely slow. I don’t know how else to describe it. Some
players may enjoy it, but I can’t say that I did. Even players who enjoy
slower strategy games might not enjoy this game’s combat.

*Get Started On Your Path To Tyranny*
Now I have talked about the one big negative and that is the combat but
don’t let this deter you as the rest of the game is quite enjoyable. It has
re-playability through just the character creation, not to mention the
choices you will have to make. It also has a unique and interesting story
to keep you hooked. I can safely say that a lot of people will enjoy this
game despite the combat gameplay being kind of a let down.

Environment is dynamic, interesting and polished. In whole game you´ll visit a lot of nice places. Sometimes I found myself just looking around and getting screenshots.

Gameplay is smooth, with decent animations and I enjoyed it by far. The game isn´t for impatient players. You have to try different strategies, be concentrated and you have to think.

Story isn´t very interesting. I am sure it will be familiar for you - serial killer is betrayed and he wants to execute a revenge.

The game set a funny tone, all the characters are stereotype and have funny dialog. I really enjoy the fact that you evolve through time (if you have the DLC modern times). There is a lot of things to explain about the game so I make it quick : it's really a complete (if you have all the dlc) and funny game, the only thing that misses is building tunnels and bridges (that feature is available in Tropico 6).

6694,The Sims: Medieval,14.34,,-28%,Europe,0,Origin,https://www.instant-gaming.com/en/130-buy-game-origin-the-sims-medieval/,Out of stock,['Simulation'],24 March 2011,75,"Voilà des années que nous sommes pour la plupart familiarisés aux sims, ces personnages à incarner dans leur vie de tous les jours pour une simulation plus vraie que nature lors de péripéties rocambolesques. Mais avec les Sims Médiéval, EA fait sortir l'univers déjà bien connu par la communauté de ses habitudes somme toute contemporaines pour les téléporter au temps des chevaliers. Si l'approche pouvait paraître un brin farfelue en premier temps, la sauce prend relativement bien et on se surprend même à aimer ça. Plus appréhendé ici sous un angle différent puisque le but est davantage de superviser et développer le monde où ils vivent que de les incarner dans un environnement déjà totalement établi, ce jeu nous offre une nouvelle manière de découvrir ou redécouvrir les sims.

Il faudra prendre néanmoins certaines choses en compte avec cet opus car même s'il s'agit d'un jeu estampillé ""sims"", le gameplay se retrouve bien plus épuré et centré sur les personnages, le royaume et les objectifs que sur la personnalisation et la simulation de vie pure. En d'autres termes, si vous êtes bien aux commandes d'un personnage que vous aurez défini de vous-même, vous devrez suivre la barrière de construction de l'histoire : vous débutez dans un royaume qui aura besoin d'un roi, d'un chevalier, d'un forgeron, marchand, médecin, etc. Et ces 10 personnages indispensables, c'est vous qui devrez les incarner à tour de rôle, étape par étape et en fonction des missions proposées lorsque vous en terminez une. Les bâtiments et décors sont eux redécorables mais vous devrez vous contenter de structures déjà installées, impossible de modifier votre maison ou château pour y rajouter des pièces, des étages ou en changer la disposition pure vous ne pourrez que retapisser les murs et installer les meubles qui vous conviennent.

Pour faire prospérer votre royaume, vous devrez remplir des quêtes dans la peau de vos héros, parfois avec la possibilité d'en choisir l'un ou l'autre, ce qui influencera le déroulement de celle-ci. La réalisation de ces objectifs vous permettra de débloquer davantage de lieux et donc de personnages qui y sont liés. Plus vous en débloquerez, plus votre domaine sera peuplé et florissant. Il vous faudra également traiter avec les royaumes voisins pour établir une paix durable ou repousser des envahisseurs à l'aide de l'épée, logique si l'on s'en tient à la thématique médiévale.

Magie et humour sont également au rendez-vous pour égailler un peu plus ce thème qui aurait pu sembler trop sérieux, il n'est d'ailleurs par rare que les missions à remplir soient carrément loufoques. (les chinchillas en prennent par ailleurs pour leur grade assez souvent). Les personnalités des sims rajoutent également un peu de piquant à l'aventure puisque vous devez nécessaire lui donner des qualités ET des défauts, vous retrouvant donc parfois avec des sims lubriques, ivrognes, solitaires, avides de sang, j'en passe et des meilleures. Les romances sont toujours de mise ainsi que la possibilité de faire prospérer votre arbre généalogique. 

Niveau visuel, sans avoir un ordinateur ""bête de compétition"" le rendu est correct et fluide, à l'image des opus de la licence et sachant que le jeu est sorti en 2011, il aura donc probablement prit un peu d'âge à vos yeux si vous ne vous y intéressez que maintenant. J'ai pu constater qu'il était mieux supporté que les Sims 3, sans doute à cause des différences de gameplay qui allègent le contenu (pas besoin d'une montagne d'outils pour les maisons puisqu'elles sont réduites au minimum). Il est également un peu en dessous de celui-là en terme de qualités des graphismes.

En conclusion, les Sims Médieval peut s'avérer assez plaisant à jouer si l'on est plus porté sur le côté ""aventure/objectifs"" que la simulation pure des autres titres mais son individualité reste assez intéressante même si l'on n'y retrouve pas des éléments qu'on aurait pu également apprécier ici. L'humour reste très présent et l'intérêt va en grandissant. La durabilité est plutôt bonne, une partie impliquant de suivre le récit de plusieurs protagonistes et une évolution d'un domaine sur plusieurs niveaux, ça reste au final assez conséquent.",70

First of all i'd like to say despite the log in issues and connection errors during launch day i can't say i'm not happy about this game. Instead i have to honestly say i really like the animations, the colours, the way this game feels and plays (i'm not a pro player) and i won't say it's as hard to master than the previous one(s) but i bet it's still challenging yet more inviting for novices that are new to Street Fighter of fighting based games in general. 
What about the content?
Well, the Story Mode has been largely cut into chapters (1-4 fights instead of 1-10 per character) and that isn't much tbh, but who knows what they might add as free updates/content etc in due time? At least I want more of this game!!! :)
The main attraction is still the Multiplayer aspect of this game and it clearly shows that from the start so people who expected a huge single player story or arcade mode might be a bit displeased by that not being much or even missing within the current vanilla SF5 game.. 
However guys, there's still plenty of goodness to enjoy with this game and i recommend others to give i a try as well.

Comme à chaque extension, vous retrouverez de nombreux terrains préconstruits comme par exemple une salle de sport ou encore une laverie. Du côté des objets on retrouve également des nouveautés encore jamais vues comme des jeux d'extérieur pour aires de jeux mais également des variantes d'objets déjà présents comme de nouveaux sèches linge et machines à laver, ainsi que des appareils de sports sophistiqués. Et n'oublions pas les nouvelles tenues qui, il faut le souligner, restent néanmoins extrêmement banales.

Cet add-on n'apporte aucun changement notable dans le fonctionnement du jeu mais égaye la vie de vos sims, et de rentrer volontairement dans une routine citadine (aller laver son linge, accompagner ses enfants dans le jardin public, aller à la salle de sport tous les soirs après le travail).

En este dlc volvemos a ver a nuestros compañeros y jugamos con ellos, sabremos qué tal están después de 2 años y cómo les va en la vida. Pero lo mejor de todo es en el proceso: una de las decisiones que tuvimos que hacer durante el juego principal tomará su mayor repercusión aquí (y si cierto PJ está presente en ese instante es aún mejor). Añado además que las dos decisiones finales del juego nos ponen en situación para el siguiente juego.

Podremos visitar La Encrucijada (The Crossroads) que, para mi sorpresa durante una segunda visita con otro personaje, cambia dependiendo de la raza en los colores. Los lugares a investigar han sido bellamente diseñados, algunos me quedaría horas observándolos. También hay puzles y mucha información nueva, y el Áncora de la mano también dará nuevas ""habilidades"" (si se le puede llamar de esa manera).

La música es sublime, mucho mejor que la del juego principal y muy emotiva. Rivaliza en algunas pistas con la del dlc ""Descenso"" pero sin duda la supera. Sobre todo, me sorprendió muchísimo darme cuenta de que casi cada instrumento o familias de instrumentos en este DLC marcan quién es cada personaje. Ejemplo: tambores = qunari. ¡Impresionante! ¡hasta la música te cuenta todo! ¡Y hay dos canciones de taverna nuevas! 

Muchos se quejaron en su momento de que no debería haber salido como DLC sino que debería haber estado en el juego, la realidad es que no se pretendió hacer un dlc ya que esto estaba pensado que ocurriese en el siguiente juego; posteriormente se dijo que no, se cortó y, para que los jugadores entendiesen qué ocurría, lo añadieron como dlc. A pesar de que éste es un final (UNO) para DAI (que ya tuvo su cierre, abierto, sí, pero lo tuvo), creo que habría sido más imprescindible que el DLC ""Legacy"" de DA2 estuviera como ""obligatorio"" o dentro del propio juego (ya que el villano es directamente el de DAI) que éste dlc ""Tresspasser"".

Se jeux a vraiment tout pour plaire. 

Le jeux ne se prend pas la tête sur une quelconque stratégie ou autre, c'est un jeux somme toute dans un principe de fonctionnement tout simple, on a un vaisseaux, on améliore ou crée de nouvelle arme, on suis les quète, on gagne de l'argent, on combat, on achète de meilleur vaisseaux, en soit le principe de base est simple.

L'histoire est intéressante, sans être exceptionnelle, les combat sont très beaux, immersif et parfois tactique, le choix des armes est large, le choix des vaisseaux encore plus, et le système de récupération de plan pour ensuite crée des arme, chasseur ou amélioration encore plus puissante est vraiment sympas. Le système qui permet d'améliorer chaque facette du vaisseaux ( comme les bouclier, les arme, les réacteur ) est aussi très interessante.

Se que se jeux a de plus, c'est le fait de pouvoir récupérer les vaisseau adverse en les abordant et en les ramenant a une station spacial ou une base, qui nous demande de vendre ou de garder le vaisseau. On peut aussi choisir de se faire accompagner par 2 mercenaire qui combattrons a nos cotée et de lancer 3 escadrille de chasseur. On a aussi la possibiliter de traquer des '' héro '' qui rapporte une grosse prime a chaque héro abattue, avec une difficulté plus ou moins élevée.

Les 2 DLC du jeux rajoute a eux seul beaucoup de contenue.

Seuls points négatifs pour moi, les mercenaire qu'on engage reste trop loin du vaisseau et intervienne trop lentement, quelque beug très perturbant bien que vraiment rare ( le vaisseau du joueur qui se détruit sans aucune raison avec la vie pleine ), la trop grande faciliter a vendre les arme rare par erreur et enfin, le fait que le jeux devienne assez restreins une fois que tout est fait, même si c'est très long a faire.

It goes around kung-Fu battles with varying modes and styles. It is a game based on attacking and wrecking. A brawler where you punch left or punch right. Rhythm game-like, but with no rhythm. The actual rhythm comes with the fighting where every click is an actual attack.
The player needs to attack when the enemy is in the range of the attack. The ranges change depending on how well you are doing. So if you combo enough the range gets bigger and may let you do a charge move. Weapons give you extra range too.

*Story*
The game basically goes around a solo fighting stickman that battles hundreds of enemies advancing in chronological order. The game is easy to learn and but pretty much challenging to master. Well as a matter of fact the game cannot be mastered since you always are prone to hit one extra button by mistake. You start as a student. After several levels you unlock master levels where it gets harder. After master is completed, you unlock grandmaster where the difficulty is maxed out and the gameplay gets to its extreme. Can you make it from a student all the way to a grandmaster?

*Controls*
Speaking of the control configuration, they are pretty much the simplest ones out there; LMB to attack left, RMB to attack right. That's all of it.

*Graphics*
As an overview of the game's graphics, they are decent for an indie game. What's cool is that some objects in the background can be used to kill opponents. Some opponents are kicked into tables or walls that are in the background and break them. Some killings have cinematics like breaking the skull that happens in slow motion and lets you take a breath from the fight and enjoy the sound of the breaking.

*Skills*
Skills can be acquired by reaching a certain level and playing it. Some skills are cool and important to the fights and some are just there for no important reason.

*The enemies*
First comes the basic ones. The ones that can be one shot. Those ones aren’t a big deal. A simple LMB or RMB and you’re done with them. No matter how many they are and how frequent they come, if all the enemies are like basics, you can ace the battle with a 10/10 health.
Second comes the dodgers. Those ones come tricky since in the middle of the fight, you get one that needs to be hit one to the left then ones to the right. It might not be a problem, but with high speed and high frequency of enemies, those ones are damned. Some of the dodgers come of three hits or four hits. ( 3 hits as in L-R-L for example and 4 hits as in R-L-R-L)
Third comes the tanks. Those are easier than the dodgers since they require you to hit them two, three, or four times but in the same direction. (like 3 rights, or 2 lefts and so on).
Fourth comes the mixed ones where they are tanks and dodgers. Those are the ones that have a weird combo to hit them. They require 3 or 4 hits which are like (L-L-R-L, R-R-L-L, R-R-R-L) and so on.
Fifth comes the enemies that have a crown above their heads. These have a so-called brawl attached to them where there is a specific combo that shows on the screen and you must hit the right keys in the right order to get rid of them.
Finally, there are the bosses. Boss fights are cool since a boss changes pattern every time you hit him and has a long life which makes it nice to keep on hitting him right and left.

*Conclusion*
All in all, the game is fun to play and competitive if someone wants to fully complete it. The story isn’t a story, pretty much completing levels to unlock another. Skills are there to upgrade the experience. Weapons are there to spice up the battle and add fun to it. Nobody should ignore this because of its graphic style, because it looks like a web game. Everyone should pretty much play it because it is satisfying and vicious and responsive. For the cool level variety, for the fun and challenge in every level, and just for pure Kung-Fu experience.

I like the option of being able to play co-op locally (couch) or Online a lot. The game play is very easy to get used to, has fast action and has a very Contra-like feel to it (which I like a lot). There are a lot of upgrades you come across in which most use money you find in game. The world/map changes every time you play which makes the replay factor very high. The action gets pretty intense in which newbies to these types of games will die pretty quick, but if you are like me you'll like the challenge.

Subnautica is an aquatic-themed survival exploration game. The premise of the game is that your spaceship has crashed on this primarily water-filled planet. You are aware of alien life present on the planet and are armed with just a knife. You must explore and survive, with your end goal being get off the planet by rebuilding your ship. 

Breakdown
Early access done right
I’d like to start off by pointing out that this game started out in early access and has been completed. There aren’t many games that do that these days. A lot of developers just take the cash and announce the full release the game without fulfilling their promises, or don’t even release it at all!. Early access survival games are mostly seen as a cash grab rather than an opportunity to make a good game. If anyone is interested in seeing how to go about making an early access game, then Subnautica is the perfect example. The devs deserve kudos for their work and integrity.

Mediocre story, No combat
You read that right. The gameplay is ok, and combat is pretty much non-existent in this game. Your only lethal weapon is a knife in a huge ocean, the primary biome, filled with creatures that want to kill you. The beauty of this game lies in its emphasis on exploration without any combat. You are aware of the alien presence near your crash site from the beginning. You explore to discover hidden caves and bases which give you new technology that helps you fix your ship. The game might not have any combat, but it shows that not every survival game needs to be about killing everything in your way. 

Beautiful World
The game is gorgeous. When you are underwater, the god rays moving make it look lifelike. It gives the water this turquoise tint that makes everything underneath, from plants, to animals, and even the terrain, pop and give it a little more edge. This ties in well with the biggest plus point to this game: the exploration. While exploring in other games may be tedious, and even feel like a chore, in this one, it fits right in with the outstanding visuals present. 

What about replayability?
Sadly, this is one thing the game lacks. There isn’t really any incentive to play the game again after finishing it as the story is mediocre, and once you’ve explored everything, you pretty much know everything about the game. Although, there is a creative mode which eliminates what threats there are and lets you build amazing bases you can call home. Thankfully, the crafting and base building systems are fully fleshed out and this game mode is a fun experience.

A simple yet wonderful game
As you may be able to tell by now, this game is very simple, yet a fun experience. It doesn’t try to do much and what it does, it delivers phenomenally well. If you are looking for a casual game that you can kick back and enjoy, then this is it. Whether it is after a rough day’s work, or through the Sunday afternoon, this game will relax you and keep you hooked at the same time. I haven’t even mentioned that it is just the type of game that showcases the beauty of VR and should be a plus point for VR gamers. Subnautica offers about 20 hours of content, and would make a fine addition to the steam library of anyone who likes relaxing games with an emphasis on exploration. Definitely recommended!
